[[Session 2021.01.17 Where’s Krampus r]] -> [[../people/Kala]] | 2022-01-18
**Kala** wears very fancy armour, some sort of Elven Mithril. Able to cast spells.

  

We ask Kala about the Godvale and stuff, she tells us she can take us there, most people know where it is, the trouble is accessing it:

**Godvale is a test**, trouble isn’t getting there, it’s getting an audience, they can’t guarantee we’ll survive the audience but can probably get us one. Test to give you what you want. “Was she of this plane originally?”

Kala is from Nythm’Thalas
