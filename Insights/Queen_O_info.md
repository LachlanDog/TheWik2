Ask someone about the king:

-   ‘**He doesn’t seem like he’s all there**’
    
-   “**Especially now ‘wahh my wife**’”
    
    -   She ‘died’ – long time ago
        
    -   **Body is still in the throne room on display** ‘Mr. Freeze type situation’
        
    -   “She’s dead, she’s there, but **she made that choice** if you know what I mean”
        
    -   “**She was very unhappy**” – pretty depressed, **didn’t want to get married**, never got to do anything she wanted
