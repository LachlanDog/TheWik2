[[Session 2021.01.17 Where’s Krampus r]] -> [[../people/Kala]] | 2022-01-18
For the most part, the other watches pass mostly uneventfully -- until on Briza’s, she sees some elf-like creature near the edge of camp, about 80’ away, blue sallow skin, white pupiless eyes. She yells for its attention then waves at it, it waves back, but doesn’t speak.
 

The elf asks what we’re doing and how many friends she has. Briza says we’re looking for Thera and as many as she can get. The elf says their name is **Kala** and they are looking. The elf knows of Vakkmigr but not personally

**Kala wants Briza to show them around inside the fortress, says they’ll take us to the godvale if she does**. Kala says they are from a big city.
