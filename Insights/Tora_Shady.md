[Session 2020.07.12 Holmgren the Devil Worshipper r](../sessions/notes_matteo_brianedit/Session%202020.07.12%20Holmgren%20the%20Devil%20Worshipper%20r.md) -> [Daveed r](TheWik-main/people/Daveed%20r.md) | 2022-01-19
-   Daveed insinuates Tora is very shady, has asked Holmgren why we’re with her anyways and when Holmgren said he loves her ‘There’s plenty of other people out there.’
    
-   Daveed: “No one ever says they’re working with Tora, or plenty do but they’re never right. She only has people working for her.”
    
-   He stresses again as Holmgren asks that he has no idea where Tora was
