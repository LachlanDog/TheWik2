[Session 2020.06.07 The Truth about Aloy & Meteors r](TheWik-main/sessions/notes_matteo_brianedit/Session%202020.06.07%20The%20Truth%20about%20Aloy%20&%20Meteors%20r.md) -> [Bolero](TheWik-main/people/Bolero.md) | 2022-01-19
As we get to courthouse, prisoner wagon comes through crowd, Blue dragonborn inside -- Tora breaks out, recognizes him, runs out and has the following conversation in Dwarvish:
#Dwarvish
She calls him: Bolero
#Bolero
**He calls her: Jad’zeeya = Tora**
#Jadzia 
“I was trying to get up the fucking mountain” -- B

“**I’m not like Jerome, I’m not some fucking messiah**, I don’t care about the means to this end, I care about the end.” -- B
#Jerome 
==“I got it, I have the conch, it’s in my room” -- B==
#Conch
At some point they switched to Draconic but I still understood.

Confront Tora about this after, she’s very upset and runs off for a bit but then come back -- we speak in Sylvan, not to hide from party but just passerbys

She knows this guy, somehow related to her and Jerome -- says he shouldn’t be in there and do not assassinate him (that’s why I asked in Sylvan)

I try to reassure her that we’re her friends and want to help her with and through this but we don’t know tf is going on -- **I guess that it’s something about they had some club or were all friends in High School, learned about the artifacts and grouped together to find them**, either for power or something (and so maybe she’s not fully honest about all of their intentions with them) -- **she says this isn’t too far off from the truth** (not the not being honest part, just the friends trying to find artifacts) and her and Varenzai share their first kind of nice moment
