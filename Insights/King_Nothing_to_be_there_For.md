King’s not exactly crazy but not really all there anymore, Denethor kinda deal

-   He’s not totally there, but I’m not really sure that he has a lot to be there for anyways
    
-   “Thing’s take on a different kind of light when you live as long as our kind do”
    
-   His kids are very adamant about ruling, if something were to happen he wouldn’t be leaving nothing behind
    

-   They’re educated, they are twerps
