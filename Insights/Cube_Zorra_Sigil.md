Lachlan has some Cube thing from somewhere that he asks Zorra what it does

-   He got the sigil from Urithana within the Faewild
    

-   Works like Circle of Teleportation, lets you teleport to a sigil that you know
    
-   Zorra has her own circle/sigil! Asks Zorra if we can learn & use hers
    
-   Lachlan asks if she has any rules, she kinda asks what we’d expect then lays down some groundrules
    

-   No Food
    

-   I perception check La’Ni and he is actively eating a bag of almonds
    

-   No fire
    
-   Certain times
    

-   There are many hours when it is not allowed. I do not live here all the time. I live here some of the time
    
-   “Is there a schedule?” “No, it depends upon my studies, others are not allowed to be here when I am not here”
    
-   If we teleport in and she’s not here we must leave the library immediately
    

Zorra examines the sigils that are currently running on the cube

-   They seem to be constantly changing, she says they connect to somewhere within the Faewild
    
-   Foreboding: It is tied to some creature (its mood and attitude) that can determine where the sigil goes – rather than tied to some specific place
