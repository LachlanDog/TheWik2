[[Session 2021.06.06 The Resurrection of Jadzia Bronzerock r]] -> [[../people/Entheri]] | 2022-01-18
7-8 years ago a bunch of [[../people/Entheri]] came through to a cavern that was once a forest ~10km from here, not really sure why, I donâ€™t have a specific memory
    
-   Otherwise no one of my people has really been through, but various members of other races have for different reasons, looking for shelter or fey treasures or travelling between cities, or lost
