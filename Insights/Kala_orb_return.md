Lachlan has a bit of a back and forth with Kala about what she’s up to

She says:

**The orb belongs to Nythm’Thalas, as do I**, I am returning it. **Many thought it was here** but it was difficult to get to.

She denies that it relates to her **trials in the Godvale**, says **she has no desire to be tested there**.
