[[Session 2020.08.16 The Closed Day r]] -> [[Godvale]] | 2022-01-18
Thrall tells us this about the [[godvale]]:

**Thrall is not from this plane**, they come from Dream plane

**Tree is god**, will judge, if good you’ll go where you’re going (some sort of portal connected to dream plane?)

**Ulutiu, god of the Godvale tree,** God of the Ice and the arctic. Rangers and people who follow the nature of the Arctic worship him
