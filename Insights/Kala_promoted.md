I ask if Ka’la ever comes by -- he looks to his mom and says something in their frog language, -- then he says she comes by sometimes but it wouldn’t really appropriate for her to fight because **she’s a general**, so mostly like because **she’s a professional soldier** not really a fair fight.

Good to know thought **Kala Ka’la** is still around, and is a general -- **maybe promoted after she recovered those artifacts**.
