### From Insight Check:

-   She’s clearly looking for something specific and powerful/magical in the fortress.
    
    -   **Most interested in the closed door Briza is describing that she couldn’t get through**
        
    -   She’s giving a polite interest to the other thing Briza is saying, but is most interested in that.
        
-   Probably heard from scouting reports or something what had happened at the fortress, and that it was more easily accessible now.
    
    -   **Some militaristic/driven character about them.**
        
-   **Godvale is in Nythm’Thalas**, the audience we seek has to be with the king there.
    
    -   ==Some hint of sadness when they spoke of it, as if they sought something from it and were unsuccessful in trying to gain it.==
        
-   **They genuinely did recognize Briza**, they’re somewhat older for an elf and the way they said I know you was more **with a sense of nostalgia**, like remembering someone they knew from a long time ago
