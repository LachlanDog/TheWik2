[[../people/Octavius]] IS ALOY’S SON!

[[../people/Aloy]] backstory session, from Roe

-   Very popular in town, solved everyone’s problem
    
-   Was killed by accident by the king, wild magic accident
    
-   Town had big parade and funeral pyre, very sad when she died
    
-   She was prepared, did some necromancy spell to have a clone of her younger self ready when she died, soul went into that body once she passed. People did not like this, that’s why Octavius is mad at her.
