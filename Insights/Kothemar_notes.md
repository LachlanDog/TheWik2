Ko’Themar:

-   Lots of dwarven monuments, six ones facing away from the city
    
-   Lots of **Blue Arctic Roses -- a stoic flower native to the region**
    
-   Different districts have cool names: fancier one, crafting one, arcane one
    
    -   Different tavern options, many types, spas, baths, brothels:
        
        -   Fools blade: mid/lower range -- this is where we’re staying
            
        -   Brightcastle: Higher end
            
        -   Velvet Pillow: Brothel
            
-   Temple
    
    -   A priest or something named Gull sent me to the Prodigal manner (grand temper), or some shrine in the Hell hound district
        
    -   Its super naturey and druidy there are birds and I like them
        
    -   Temple to the Lord of Plants
