[[Session 2021.07.11 The Funeral of Holmgren Grenwold r]] -> [[../people/Queen_Winter_Court]] | 2022-01-18
[[../things/Dusk_Eladrin]] -- **creatures of the queenâ€™s court of shadow** and darkness and apathy. Sees no value in life, and highly trained to fulfill any task on her behalf.

-   Investigation Roll: The way they were moving, always surrounded by wisp and shadow, unsure exactly where the physical form is, but I find one. No blood. The more time that passes, the more the shadow just slightly dissipates.
    
-   Appearance of a very dark elf with this melancholy aura around it, even in death
    
-   A Dusk Eladrin is **an elf that has gone down a very dark path**
