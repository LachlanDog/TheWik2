[[Session 2021.06.06 The Resurrection of Jadzia Bronzerock r]] -> [[../people/Entheri]] | 2022-01-18
Threshold Crest -- Magical stones that anchor something, like a city/region/place and allow it to transport to another plane of existence in a time of crisis

This is what the [[../people/Entheri]] used to shift [[Elysia]] to another

NOT BOUND TO ANYTHING NOT SURE WHERE

Essentially: the entheri didn’t want to be bound to the material anymore, but in doing so fucked up, helped create ‘leyline crsis’ where the planes are beginning to bleed over into one another, and they are no longer bound to any one place, not sure where they are now
