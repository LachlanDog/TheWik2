[[Session 2021.01.17 Briza’s Body r]] -> [[../places/Frost_Giant_FortressR]] | 2022-01-18
Runes along the wall, iconography dragon and lunar

A lot of the bodies are not tossed around or in the middle of doing something, they’re all laying in bed in their cots like they died lying there.

What is on their skeletal remains is very simple, like this is a temple -- seems like this was a temple to Bahamut once, but based on the stories told in the pictures this isn’t the original Bahamut as I know it but some different sect.

There is one picture in particular that a lot of the stories and images lean to, and it looks like a fabric carved into the stones
