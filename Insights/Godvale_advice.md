To Ask in Library before we go

-   Advice about Audience
    

-   She asks what are intentions are
    
-   Can’t tell you what to do godvale-wise – what are you willing to give
    
-   Can be like a ‘group-sacrifice’ – like it’s not clear cut as it has to be one thing from Varenzai for something in return – it just demands some sort of sacrifice, but this can come from many, not just one alone
    
-   Ka’la warns that Varenzai won’t be ready when he’s there – there’s no way you can be
    
-   People don’t come in and ask about it, people don’t come in and ask about it.
