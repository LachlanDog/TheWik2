[[Session 2021.01.17 Where’s Krampus r]] -> [[../places/Frost_Giant_FortressR]] | 2022-01-18
We go into an old-timey like study, so many quills and books with old bindings. A pedestal on the left has a cloth covering something circular.

Beside it, near desk, some sort of **shattered glass crystal** thing that looks like it once had something in it now gone.

  

Behind desk is a mummified, at least dead for 100 years, emaciated, wearing a fine scholars robe with gold embroidery, greyish skinned, **older version of Briza**, not just like related, but looks exactly like Briza. Same hair and everything but not blue.

ASK KALA HOW SHE KNOWS BRIZA AND WHAT THIS IS AND DO SOME CHECK ON THE BODY  
Theory: Based on how it seems like Kala knows another version of Briza, and what we saw with Aloy, is it possible Briza did the same sort of thing, making and inhabiting a clone body, but for some reason she doesn’t remember. And this is the old one?

Theory 2 (unrelated): Kala is here looking for things related to whatever made them fail in what they were trying to get from the Godvale.
