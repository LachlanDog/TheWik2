More time passes through the evening, it gets darker outside as Zorra continues working on the puzzle box

-   Eventually something click, and another level opens – the final third level!
    
-   Takes one hour per level
    
-   All we know about it is that if you fail a level it resets and locks for 24 hours
    
-   Zorra: “I have completed it. Thank you, that was very fun.”
    
-   Because Zorra was the one who solved & opened the box, she’s now the only one who can freely open the box – but anyone else, including Briza, would need to solve it again once it locks
