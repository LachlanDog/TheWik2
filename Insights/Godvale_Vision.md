[GODVALE DESCRIPTION]

Towards the end of the ritual when Varenzai feels it should be over, he has a vision. He is standing before a great **White Tree**, glittering like Moonstones. He has flowers and leaves plants sprouting along his arms. Looking down water begins to rise around his feet with an icy bitter biting cold. **He moves towards the tree as the cold seeps up his limbs, and it brings him warmth and comfort.**

Arriving at the tree out of the cold he is hit by an **intense wave of familiarity** within the tree stronger than anything he’s ever felt. He realises **the tree is not white, but actually crystalline** and made of crystal. Reaching the tree **he feels his bond to Thera**, like a vine entwining them together stronger than it ever has been, and **understands it is his past and future.** As he awakens, Thera does not return -- **he realises she is not gone but trapped somewhere.**

Varenzai gets the sense this tree is somewhere in the arctic, sees that terrain and mountains around it. Doesn’t know exactly what it means, but wants to **ask someone who knows magical history -- ALOY**. Gets the sense that ==Thera feels lost, is also trying to get back but can’t find the way.==
