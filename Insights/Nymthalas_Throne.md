We walk into the palace, it’s massive and ornate, crystalline

  

We walk by different large rooms, large doors, very fancy, can look in and there’s all kinds of books or ornate thing

-   But they’re all covered by thin white sheets, looks almost like ghosts
    
-   Looks all put away and clean, steril
    

  

Walk by different stone & marble statues of famous old elves, showing the lineage etc.

  

Castle gets colder & colder & colder as we walk through

  

Finally we are lead to a grand room, massive arched doors that are two storeys tall

-   Echoey and empty sounding
    
-   Lots of people inside, but no life, completely silent, no vibrancy
    

  

Throne room looks like it’s made of ice, but not as cold as we expect – a coldness, but emanating from behind the throne, like there’s other rooms past it

-   Blue shimmering crystals throughout
