[[Session 2021.08.01 The Well of the Candlemaker r]] -> [[../people/Candlemaker]] | 2022-01-18
As we go, Candlemaker holds up hand to stop -- we see a human-looking figure about 15-20â€™ off the path, impaled on a poleaxe, gashed and lacerated, intestines pouring out, eyeballs missing

CANDLEMAKING

The surrounding area almost seems decorated with the gore

Candlemaker approaches it, starts cutting off some of the skin and fat of the body, sticks hand right in, pulls out bloody hand, puts hand together, twists them as if wringing out a rag, opens hand and there is a candle.

Leans down and places it to the path on one side.
