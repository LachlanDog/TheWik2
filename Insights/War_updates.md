The Library

Vola looks through the library for periodicals/news, tries to look up information on the war and what we missed over the past 3 days

-   Seems very controlled, nothing too emotional or anything
    
-   Nothing critical, not full-on 1984, but very ‘safe’ and ‘easy to digest’
    
-   General advice about things to ration etc.
