[[Session 2021.01.17 Briza’s Body r]] -> [[../people/Vorgrim]] | 2022-01-18
Vola med checks the body we found. She finds a ceremonial looking dagger on it, and the throat is slit, looks self-inflicted

**The body seems to be 120~130 years old**

**This gnome was about ~450 years old when died**, skin has turned grey but seemed to originally be the same colour as **Briza**’s, a bit shorter than Briza but probably because of age. **Faded ring line**

We find books on her desk opened to a page, its written in celestial then common then gnomish. **Titled Vorgrims Frozen Tempest, crossed out and retitled Vorgrims Grimoire of Echoes**. There was also a Journal.
