**Daveed Visit:**

Lachlan enters, Daveed is upset, comforting his daugher -- shop is closed but we go in

When we come in, sends his daughter home

I ask if this means we’re done our contract “You’re never done.” Along the lines of ‘don’t you understand what you did signing that book, you’re in now’.

Stresses “Didn’t you understand what I meant when I said we were equals, why would I understand anything more than you do”

Doesn’t answer when I ask where Ly’Ara is. Says he doesn’t know where Tora is or that Bolero was in the city (Bolero = Biaro)

Basically just gets mad at us, is clearly upset at being used as a pawn and doesn’t want to talk about it, shoos us out.

Lachlan tries taking some healing potions and supplies as we walk out -- gets cursed

As I go out I say “I thought you’d know more about your family affairs is all” He takes great offense to this, tries to curse me but we get out.
