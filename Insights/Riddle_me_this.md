[[Session 2021.01.17 Where’s Krampus r]] -> [[../places/Frost_Giant_FortressR]] | 2022-01-18
We get to a room that’s mostly stone, some ice, as though the raw side of the mountain. **It was Briza’s quarters**, distant from the main hall, very not nice place, a sort of ‘we hate you so go live over there’ Harry Potter under the stairs type deal

  

  

As we continue in we get to a very fancy door with some markings on it, this is the door **Briza could never get through when exploring**

  

The engravings are in **Celestial**, Holmgren is (finally) able to read it. It says something about the formation of the world, the primordial gods coming together to make it, they fear one things

Men desire me in public and fear me in private.

  

“In the time before time, the gods sprang fully formed from the primeval void. All these ﬁrst gods were equally endowed with the power of the cosmos, and each claimed jurisdiction over certain aspects of the universe. In a spirit of cooperation that has not been seen since, they built the worlds together, separating matter from energy, land from sea, and sky from earth. They only fear one thing.

Men alike desire me in public, but fear me in private.”

  

**Briza has a flask of dirt**.

  

Kala ends up being the smart one, casts Tongues or something on herself, and says “The Truth” in **celestial**, allowing the door to open.
