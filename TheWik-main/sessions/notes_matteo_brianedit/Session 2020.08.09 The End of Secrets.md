## Initial stuff after saving Tora

Holmgren, Lachlan, & Briza investigate the room

The Fiends are some sort of evil thing that tortures people to create memories for them to eat. They love human flesh

Side note: Kudzu footfalls only work in Home Forest.

Jadzia is very anxious to leave and Varenzai is very upset. He leaves first, and then the party follows soon after.

Hotel is in alert mode, party confirms at least 1 dead on the ground around hotel.

Return to Fool’s Blade, at top floor I briefly confront Jadzia, give her back the War Fan of Admiral Hutzin.

Jadzia, Holmgren, Vola, Varenzai, Lachlan return to our rooms. Briza stays downstairs and eats with Lorca & Nemo.

Nemo tells Briza the banquet is cancelled and the city is put on lockdown for 5 more days. Yonder is in charge of their ship in the meantime.

Lachlan has a sad moment with Griffon talking about his past owner Lexi (she had a child with Griffon, dead now or something) He has ‘echo stones’, they’re like a recording of that person. Gives one to Lachlan.

  

## Briza’s Papers

  

Briza looks through the papers she found at the room. Appears to be crazy notes in various languages written by Zanzibar. One seems to be some weird language spoken by the ‘Ghyf’. There are a few maps and a list of names:

-   Lati Grook -- This one is crossed out -- Cruel Headmistress from Holmgren’s orphanage, Asher found her dead.
    
-   Asher Drake
    
-   Orion ‘Dawnrunner’ Montgomery
    

## Bumps in the Night

  

Everyone goes to sleep, Varenzai performs the ritual to bring back Thera.

Vola wakes up in the middle of the night, surrounded by darkness but feeling calm and focused.

She realises she’s in something that’s as close as to what she understands to be ‘Nirvana’ She gets an intense focus on the Ticking of his Clockwork Heart.

  

[GODVALE DESCRIPTION]

Towards the end of the ritual when Varenzai feels it should be over, he has a vision. He is standing before a great White Tree, glittering like Moonstones. He has flowers and leaves plants sprouting along his arms. Looking down water begins to rise around his feet with an icy bitter biting cold. He moves towards the tree as the cold seeps up his limbs, and it brings him warmth and comfort.

Arriving at the tree out of the cold he is hit by an intense wave of familiarity within the tree stronger than anything he’s ever felt. He realises the tree is not white, but actually crystalline and made of crystal. Reaching the tree he feels his bond to Thera, like a vine entwining them together stronger than it ever has been, and understands it is his past and future. As he awakens, Thera does not return -- he realises she is not gone but trapped somewhere.

Varenzai gets the sense this tree is somewhere in the arctic, sees that terrain and mountains around it. Doesn’t know exactly what it means, but wants to ask someone who knows magical history -- ALOY. Gets the sense that Thera feels lost, is also trying to get back but can’t find the way.

  

## The morning after

Morning comes with ritual not having worked, Vola talks to Lachlan about

Lots of yelling at each other, especially between Varenzai and Jadzia. Jadzia keeps saying ‘I didn’t kill Thera, I didn’t ask you to come save me’, Varenzai yells at her ‘I spend the past 3 days looking desperately for you while your boyfriend got high at a brothel, and you don’t care whether we live or die for you’.

Jadzia tells us she’s from the Western Kingdom, yells at Vola ‘They’re my people not yours, you never speak of them or bring them up for comfort etc.’, very rude.

We learn Jadzia is from Kourn’fel’Dour -- Capital of the Western Kingdom that’s going to war, Jadzia is princess here -- Bronzerock.

## The Shrine of Melvakar

Jadzia/Jerome/Bolero were at a monastery with some others, notably assistant Arch-Mage Balthazar (he’s that guy from the Jungle who made us the portal here to the Arctic). One day a horrifying event happened, and the archmage was destroyed in twisted eyes and ichor. Apparently this was the work of Dullalan/Melvakar, a very powerful archfey of the Shadowfey. He was unhappy because his magical trinkets (the all-powerful artifacts) were missing, the monastery people had to return them to appease them or he’d wreak havoc on the world, starting wars and stuff.

“We were all together at the monastery, we were there for a long time, balthazar appeared to us and we have to fix it, we have to return the artifacts to where they belong”

IT’S HAPPENING SHE SAID MELVAKAR! (Sylvan for Dul’Lahan, archfey dude).

“Most higher beings don’t comprehend that men make cities. They simply don’t comprehend that there’s a layer of reality where monkeys and pigs write poetry.” -- This made Lachlan realise that his patron is Dul’Lahan (Melvakar) some seemingly very evil ArchFey.Somehow this made them realise they need to collect the artifacts and give them back to Melvakar to stop bad things happening in the world.

  

Dullahan in Dwarvish, Majesty of the Feydark, King of the Empty Court, The Twisted Spine, Melvakar in old Elvish, Kararktos in Draconic

  

## Coronet --

the artifact in Nym’Thalas, Jadzia called it this

  

## Party Personal Details

We spend the rest of the time airing out any personal stuff

### Lachlan

Lachlan explains his owner was Lexi, who apparently also had a kid with Griffon named Lachlan -- exact timeline/connection unclear.

Says Lexi gave him the jewel on his collar. She was killed (I think) and he’s looking for her murderer.

Soon after he was awoken by his patron, apparently by Melvakar. Seemed (or feigned) not remembering much, but

### Varenzai

Tells party about being from Alaren/Faelar, left because of the resistance there, basically that it got more extremist, less about preserving nature vs. dominating other races to protect it. He fought against this with friends in a sort of underground resistance, not really open rebellion, but more like two groups against each other in the background, violence and disappearances became increasingly common etc. He left when it became too dangerous to stay, some of his friends had already left and others left after. Very close friend was trying to leave but he doesn’t know if she was successful.

  

### Vola

Had a nice home and upbringing but wanted to see the world. Trained as a blacksmith from as long as she could hold tools, good at it, but good fighter too. Always loved animals. Had a close friend, could have been something more, but they left for some reason (just moving as people do, not a big force pushing them out), so she said after that there were less reasons for her to stay, she wanted to travel and adventure before settling down.

Vola Friend: **Brene Gorel**

  

### Briza

Found and raised and protected by Frost Giant **Jarfun**. One day he died, the other giants wanted to eat her so she hid in caves and left. Eventually found a secret mountain pass opening to Mrs. S’ garden, ate from that and lived in cave until Mrs. S found her and “decided to keep me.” then we found her.

  

## Godvale

Briza recalled this matching the description of my vision for where Thera could be, we need to go here next to find her spirit. I should get herbs before doing this.
