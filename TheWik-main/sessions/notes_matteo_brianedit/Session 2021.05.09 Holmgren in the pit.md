We resume right after Holmgren splatted off the cliff

A battered and broken man in body, mind, and soul, now literally at rock bottom.

  

Vola brings Lachlan & I down with Vulture

  

We heal up Holmgren, Briza pranks us by running off but I found her.

  

Primeval Awareness: No humanoids BUT HERE THERE BE DRAGONS -- straight up, right at 8km edge directly above us

  

We pick up Ka’la’s trail at the bottom of the cavern -- her tracks lead way down deeper in, and then back up the other side of the cliff.

  

We follow her tracks down, find a small side-tunnel -- we can’t fit in but Briza and Lachlan go and find some teeth and gems and stuff. 14 moorbounder teeth

  

They find the name ‘Vorgrim’ carved into the small cavern there, and then carve their own names, then head back out.

  

They are Moorbounder Teeth! A really larger panther-like beast, can be used as a mount

  

We meet back and continue following the tracks -- claw marks around walls, seems to be from Tomb Tapper, preferentially crawled on walls rather than ground.

  

We come to a larger terminal cavern, recent campfire here, lots of Ka’la tracks around, settled dirt and dust and debris around something, like something was there that was taken -- she probably took it with her.

  

Lachlan sends out some Eldritch blasts, and is knocked back by a kind of recoil -- they feel much more powerful. -- we realise we must be in a Ley Line down here

  

We decide Lachlan should try Banishing me here to see what will happen

We each collectively hear a popping noise -- we haven’t moved but feel like we’re somewhere else where we shouldn’t be

Around us, in ~40’ radius, the ground around us has moved with us -- the area looks dark, slightly hazy, twinkling

The air is pulled down -- the rock we’re standing on plummets 30’ to the ground and shatters into a million pieces

  

A haze of ambient light with no clear source -- stone walls surrounding us are similar to where we just were, but more exaggerated.

Cavern is ~100’ in height, a bit larger than the other, some different surface details, blacker walls than they should be, but all really eerily similar but we know it’s not the same.

  

Even with my Boots of Winterland, I feel COLD -- not in an arctic way, just a piercing cold

  

Hands, goat legs, grey rocky face, hair that works like appendage -- satyr-like things

  

LOTS OF CONVERSATION STUFF -- get their names

  

They recognize Briza, call her the vandalizer, ‘she is not happy you’re here’

We deduce ‘she’ is the Queen of the Winter Court, who controls these lands -- the one Briza pissed off in a past life.

  

‘The feywild exists as an echo of the material plane.’

Time is weird, but can’t know in which direction (ie contracted or dilated) until you get out and see

Magic is wild, at least for fae, much more powerful, probably a lot more powerfully magical creature

  

Winter, Summer, Spring, Autumn court -- the main oppositing factions are summer and winter; spring and autumn are especially opportunistic

The courts do not want to necessarily eliminate one another, it’s just that they’re always vying for power against one another

Neutral courts like twilight

  

Seelie Court -- summer, good

Unseelie Court -- winter, evil

  

Analogous in a way to modrons not being aware of things except those directly above or below them -- the fae know of the existence of things, but find things outside of their own relative power insignificant, ie ‘why would I care about you?’

  

We try banishment on Vola -- we can’t leave

We’re staying in the Faewild, looking around the fortress a bit, I want to try to see if it matches the description for where Thera could be, and if not make our way to Nythm’Thalas

  

  

IMPORTANT TO INVESTIGATE: Melvakar is a powerful fey, creating chaos and discord through wars and stuff -- at all connected to all the turmoil and bad amongst my people???
