We come back still in the cave, ready to continue our exploration through the feywild and find out wtf is going on. We are just as confused each on what our specific goals are going forward.

Also we levelled up and all totally remembered to do that in advance.

  

We turn a corner -- instead of a cavern, mountainscape unexpectedly with some goat creature there:

Dark, grey, long spindly-clawed hands, two horns off of head angled off side, white pits of eyes, goat-like face, matted hair all the way down body

  

Riders, trampling of hooves and paws, black heavy riders careening through some kind of forest/swamp, leaving a trail of dead grass & trees behind them

Another creature of shadow and stuff running around

A wolflike thing with crying eyes

A wolflike thing covered in eyes

First 2 wolves and riders had trees all around them, some sort of haze and darkness

Eye-covered wolf is in a completely different place, clawing around in emptiness

  

But you can’t say beyweep

Nonononono

That word doesn’t belong there

It belongs here

  

No air

No drink

No sleep

It feeds on souls

  

Our vision fades again, then we come back to a place of darkness and emptiness

A woman, skirting around and hiding behind different places in this darkness

Goldish skin, glimmers slightly

Long blond hair, slightly grey

Magnificent sword in hand

Old man, armour matches design of her sword -- skeletal wings Lyregreen

“Avadra, 3 seconds”

And then they both lash out in time against some invisible creature, shifting in the darkness, incorporeal

Finally, a vision of some dragon -- A VOID DRAGON

  

Apricots, the goat man!

  

Lachlan: That vision was my ‘friend’, was for me

  

We come out of the mouth of the cave

Hazy mountain scape, definitely arctic

No great recognizable features, not certain where I am

  

Briza wants to use Raise Zombie on Jadzia

  

I FIND A TINY BABY ICE DRAGON -- I NAME HER AURENE (obviosuly)

I Confirm she Female

Wurmling -- 6-10 y/o min., horse by this age

Can’t speak yet, so she probably needs a lot of care right now

Dragons are not pets, they are sentient, but they can be companions, bond and companionship, very smart, can tell when being treated like a pet

Raise her as a guardian, like her adoptive parent, not as a pet

  

We hear excited voices in the distance

-- a group of goblins playing in the bones

They’re pretty nice, helpful, speak elvish to Vola & I

They lead us to their fortress

Urithana is their leader/guide, speaks lots of language, taught them Elvish, going to help them

  

The goblins don’t exactly seem trustworthy, but they say they hate the queen so that’s good enough for me for now

  

Urithana is an elf, seems to be really nice and good, makes them feel like they want to be good, they describe her how a goblin would describe an elf

  

Edge of fortress, surrounded in vines and vibrant green leaves, bright red beautiful berries

I recognize them as goodberries

Briza immediately eats one, it’s very sweet, then eats a lot more

Lots of goblins in the fortress, wooden

  

Beautiful elven structure, blue-white light cast by glowing crystal balls, a river of clear incredibly fresh water and a bridge over it

  

We come to a central dining hall

Drow with bright red hair and long red nails, ornate silks, flowing cape

Beside her gaunt goblin, cocky looking, dreadlock hair, stein of ale, other arm behind head, made entirely of ice

  

Seems to function like a normal hand/arm

  

  

SHE KNOWS WHAT’S UP WITH MY PEOPLE, ASK HER WHAT I CAN ABOUT THEM

She seems helpful, she’s going

  

Wants dragon

Can’t lie for a month

Can’t observe the ritual

She knows some stuff about feywild, ask more about Thera

Things demand sacrifice

  

  

  

**Ok so here’s a better summary of what happened:**

-   Start with weird vision of Melvakar in some mountains, and then what appeared to be the Queen of the Winter Court’s soldiers, and some creepy wolf beasts
    
    -   See accompanying rhyme above
        
-   Vision ends, we leave cave, I hear a call in the distance
    
    -   Abandoned Ice Dragon, from what I know of dragons this isn’t a normal nest or place for one to be
        
    -   I name her Aurene, and carry her wrapped in a blanket so I don’t get cold-burned
        
    -   Going to raise her, keep in mind this is like being guardian for a sentient creature, not a pet
        
-   Around side of mountain is a GIANT MOUNTAIN-SIZED HUMANOID SKELETON, and voices from it
    
    -   Voices belong to goblins playing around in the skeleton, we stealth in but Briza reveals us
        
    -   I roll a Nat 1 trying to make myself seem like a fey creature
        
    -   They seem all shifty and shady, but we determine that’s more just because of their goblin nature, they’re actually trustworthy and good natured
        
    -   They say they live with some Elf named Urithana, inspires them to be good, teaches them different languages
        
    -   They like to play charades
        
    -   They hate the queen of winter court
        
        -   Queen has no face
            
    -   They take us to their place
        
    -   Walking with them I ask if they’ve ever met any of my kind -- one says he’s seen like 40’000 and met 5’000, I assume he’s just joking around
        
        -   Later it will be revealed he was probably not just joking around
            
-   We arrive at a beautiful elven fortress thing, surrounded by vibrantly green vines growing goodberries
    
    -   Prisitine clear fresh stream runs through it
        
    -   6 hours of daylight//30 hours of night
        
        -   I get the feeling that I’ll be ok in this short term, but might suffer effects from lack of light in the long run
            
-   We arrive in a dining hall
    
    -   Urithana is a drow with flowing bright red hair, ornate silken robes, long red nails
        
    -   Seems to float around
        
    -   Seems much older and more mystical than she appears
        
    -   Various goblins around, and by her side one fancier cocky looking one with an arm made of ice
        
-   Aurene feasts on some of the meats laid out on the table
    
-   We discuss various things about who we are and where we’re from with Urithana
    
    -   She basically asks us about our goals and intentions -- we say it kinda comes down to three things:
        
        -   Save Jadzia
            
        -   Save Thera
            
        -   Get the artifacts
            
    -   She asks us if we get Jadzia what we’ll do
        
        -   Get Thera and continue artifact quest
            
    -   We ask if helping Melvakar is good, will it help people
        
        -   She says it will help some people, probably not others
            
        -   Won’t really give a straight answer on if Melvakar and what we’re doing is good and right or not
            
    -   Says she can probably tell me a lot more about Thera and the Godvale and what I need to do to save her
        
    -   Says she’s very familiar with my people, has met lots, wouldn’t really say when/how recently, and that she knows what they did with Elysia and coming to the Feywild
        
        -   COME UP WITH MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS
            
    -   Says she can bring back Jadzia, but we need to sacrifice something in return, not like diamonds and stuff, but typical fey trickery
        
        -   Someone suggests Aurene, she asks if I’d give her up, big talking ensues but I am immediately defensive and say absolutely not ,the others are like why not, Vola is on my side
            
        -   I go into a talk about how she’s a sentient creature, I am raising her but will not just trade her, it’s up to Aurene to choose her own path
            
        -   Urithana agrees with me, seems like was some sort of test of where I stand
            
    -   She says she can do a ritual, but there are stipulations
        
        -   We cannot try to observe or spy on the ritual in any way
            
        -   We cannot lie intentionally for 1 month -- YIKES
            
    -   We go off to do the ritual, putting the body from the bag on a bed -- Holmgren asks for time alone with her and spends a lot of time in private chat doing stuff discussing stuff
        
        -   sus
            
-   We end the session with Lachlan revealing he lied, and never tried casting Banishment again to return us to our home plane
