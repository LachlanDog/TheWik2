# Session: 24.05.2020: The Tower of Horrors

Ooops forgot to fill this in

From memory: We went in, found some Claptrap (borderlands) robot that was eccentric, wanted us to help plan a birthday party

From this point on, Bort locks himself in a closet and Holmgren stays behind and tries (and fails) to become Bort’s friend.

Then it sent us down the wrong path through a hall of terrible traps, I lost my left arm below the elbow

We get back, robot says it was a joke and takes us up to wizard in elevator

There’s a construct that seems to be the wizard, then a dog comes out from its robes -- that is Roe, construct is Aisha. They also have some construct dog named Noodle. They’re equals or something and they built Claptrap (Bort is the real name) to serve them.

Roe laughed at Vanuth, said she’s a narc who wants to be popular so that’s why she wants badge to speakeasy (can’t get one cause she’s a narc), I forget why but for some reason agreed to give us some.

Holmgren asks if he can buy Bort, this offends them

I ask if they’ll regrow my arm and we end the session around there.
