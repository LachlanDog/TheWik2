I missed this session.

Urzoth -- One of Jerome’s old companions, on minotaur team (monk, the one who kept stunning Vola)

-   Crossed over side of field
    
-   Not wielding any weapons
    
-   Long fingernails
    
-   Specifically scratched everyone once
    
    -   Only cared about this, triggered a ton of opportunity attacks
        
-   No magic worked on her and attacks were ineffective
    
    -   Vola noticed she was faking damage
        
    -   She was able to take damage (especially in the lava)
        

Iron Golem wasted people, and then just went away -- driven by Scourge the Undying

  

We won, celebrated afterwards at the tavern, got drunk and revelled. We won an audience with the king.

  

We went off to bed, and then we woke up in some dream realm.

  

Creature that is immune to a certain level of spell, can only be harmed by certain weapons/attacks, & relies on using it’s claws, and can curse others -- Rakshasa

-   So this is what must have done this
    
-   Who’s this about? Why would Rakshasa have taken Urzoth form
    
    -   They saw Urzoth somewhere far away, in a plain on a horse
        
    -   Jerome in some kind of library, somewhere warm
        

  

  

Prize

1000 gp each

-   Can ask for one small thing each, or one big thing together
