Chaos of the meteors, craters where the courthouse was, city in disarray

Tora recovers from blast, looks at wreck, turns into a hawk and flies to it, Briza immediately runs over to it

Briza gets to Ms. S’s body, gets rubble off of it -- she’s dead

Lachlan notices some out of place people -- 2 Tabaxi, a very pale woman, and a half-orc, helping in the crowd

  

Found body of Biaro, Tora’s friend -- he was very dead, nothing on him or around. Found feather from Tora hawk but she moved on, gone -- probably to get conch?

4 Options:

1.  Assasinate Eida
    
2.  Daveed is against Veil, wanted to kill Greyson before they could free him
    
3.  Daveed is working with Veil and this is cover to free Greyson
    
4.  Biaro was in Greyson’s place seemingly falsely accused. This relates back to Tora/Daveed/Jerome/Biaro high-school quest for the artifacts, Daveed set Biaro up because he was hot on the trail and was trying to eliminate them.
    

  

Halfling comes up to Briza mourning Ms. S, is also very upset (named Penny Silvereyes?) Guard asks if anything can be done, there must be something that can be done. “Surely he has a store…?” don’t know what that means

Briza writes in the notebook to Roe scrawling distressed “Courthouse! Now!”

  

Varenzai was looking and asking around for information about Dead Biaro (Bolero) like a prisoner manifest but was chased away by guards.

  

Half-orc from the crew cast a spell that was able to preserve Ms. S’s body. She needs 500g of diamond within 10 days to resurrect her. It’s Diamond Quest time!

Possible diamond sources

-   Roe
    
-   Daveed
    
-   Aloy
    
-   Somewhere else in the city
    
-   Somewhere outside of the city (Nym’Thalas? Halflings?)
    
-   **HOLMGREN?!?!?!?!** -- discussing where to get diamonds he says FUCK IT and pulls out a massive fucking diamond monstrous/obscene
    

  

Holmgren explains the connection to Daveed about being handed the letter and told to deliver it -- he doesn’t remember where so Varenzai doesn’t know it was given to flower girl necesarrily, but does know now that Daveed is connected.

  

Holmgren and Briza stay behind while Eida is being resurrected.

As Lachlan goes off, one of the Tabaxi crew people asks me who my friend who went off, I say Lachlan, they don’t talk to me anymore

  

Lachlan goes off to Daveed’s shop, I explain to the guards that “This is connected to Daveed and the Veil” connection of the letter, could be an attempt to break out Greyson, be on alert. Then Vola & I go after Lachlan.

  

**Daveed Visit:**

Lachlan enters, Daveed is upset, comforting his daugher -- shop is closed but we go in

When we come in, sends his daughter home

I ask if this means we’re done our contract “You’re never done.” Along the lines of ‘don’t you understand what you did signing that book, you’re in now’.

Stresses “Didn’t you understand what I meant when I said we were equals, why would I understand anything more than you do”

Doesn’t answer when I ask where Ly’Ara is. Says he doesn’t know where Tora is or that Bolero was in the city (Bolero = Biaro)

Basically just gets mad at us, is clearly upset at being used as a pawn and doesn’t want to talk about it, shoos us out.

Lachlan tries taking some healing potions and supplies as we walk out -- gets cursed

As I go out I say “I thought you’d know more about your family affairs is all” He takes great offense to this, tries to curse me but we get out.

  

The big dark Tabaxi comforts Briza. The Half-Orc successfully resurrects Eida. Penny is overjoyed as is Briza.

  

**IMPORTANT CORRECTION:** I completely misunderstood the connection with Bolero vs. Greyson -- Bolero was just there coincidentally, HE WAS NOT Greyson like I thought, he was just also there -- so like all my other plans still coulda worked or whatever.

  

ToDo:

-   Figure out WTF is going on with Tora -- Conch artifact, Bolero, Daveed, Nym’Thalas
    
-   Find a cursebreaker to get out of our contract with Company Zero
    
-   Investigate this airship business
    
-   Work more with Ms. S, after this Varenzai is probably much more that whatever’s going on she’s the best outcome
    
-   Overall Main Quest: Hire the airship people to take us over the mountains
    

  

Holmgren and Briza get Ms. S back to her home, Briza gets her presents -- a blue dress tailored to her with 2 pockets (extradimensional space), a note that says ‘you’ll be a great leader one day’ and a box of 6 magical chocolates (box of possiblities) that give her some giant fucking adventure (d100 effect per chocolate) -- she hopes it refills

Holmgren in his bag sees a flower crown he bought to give Tora and it refreshes his memory about who he gave the letter to.

Briza is determined to kill whoever delivered the letter.

  

I get back to our Inn, Tora hasn’t been back, I ask if Sphynx owner knows of a Birght Blue Dragonborn, where he might be saying, he gives me a contact “Calli” who stays near the gate and helps visitors and tourists, she might know, so I go to see him.

  

Vola & Lach get to the tower & try to get in, seems like no ones home. They can’t get in, Vola flies around on Vulture and gets yelled at, has trouble flying

Tabaxi who asked who Lachlan was finds him, tells him they need to talk and ushers him into alley, then pulls a gun in his face, “Where. The fuck. Did you get that gemstone?”
