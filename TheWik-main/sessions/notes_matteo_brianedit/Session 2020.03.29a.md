Went into sewers.

Scouted ahead, party didnâ€™t follow.

Found a secret room behind an illusory wall, triggered a fire trap -- this lead to bigger sewer section.

Vola & Lachlan got taken off secretly by roof crawlers and almost died, we found them in a lair with necrotic fungus and saved them.

Varenzai almost gotten eaten by littler worms burying into him.
