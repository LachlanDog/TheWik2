# Session: 2.07.2020: Stabby stab room

Just after we burst into room.

Didn’t really discuss because Varenzai had seen Zanzibar run off and wanted to get after her, went to open room she went into and got stabbed -- C O M B A T

She summons four fiends, we fight, almost TPK. She’s clearly not going after Holmgren, needs him for something.

Holmgren threatens to kill self to get her to stop fighting, doesn’t really work yet.

Thera dies again.

I miss with Quiver of Wonders and turn myself into a Dragon, she tries to fly out window and escape, I chase after her (debris kills some bystanders, whoops), Briza rides on back, we don’t catch her but I do get her with some flames, we return.

Jadzia, who was Tora all along (cast illusion and lied about name, Holmgren knew the whole time) starts to wake up, her and Holmgren share a touching romantic moment, Varenzai begins to mourn the loss of Thera, warns party to say Zanzibar summoned the dragon and we Banished it.
