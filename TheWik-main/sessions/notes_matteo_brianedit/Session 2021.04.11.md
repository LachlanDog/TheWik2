Meg decided to have fun with her other friends instead so no 8-am session this week.

  

We resume right where we left off in Mechanus, all of mechanus looks very similar so hard to tell where we are

  

Varenzai wakes up confused and offends holmgren who tries to punch him but misses

We debate a bit where to go and what to do next, pretty much set on reviving Jadzia

  

We decide to wrap Jadzia’s body up in the bedroll tied with silken rope, as this is happening a disposal modron runs straight for the body. Lachlan is able to dismiss it.

  

We decide instead of Grosie, we’ll go for where the modron said the nearest other living things were in this part of Mechanus

  

Holmgren gets himself locked up in prison by causing a big ruckus

  

Lachlan can control the modrons, but does not give specific enough instructions to get him back, and is now trying to talk to all the managers and superiors until he gets to a powerful enough one to help

I recommend asking if any could have resurrection magic maybe if they’re powerful enough

  

We wait for bigger more powerful modrons, Vola messes with a puzzle box Briza gave her that she said is a weapon. Vola gets it all locked up

  

We finally decide to keep walking. We have a modron follow us, eventually Briza and Lachlan order it to explode and two other modrons brutally disassemble it

  

We order another to bring us Holmgren (or a description of him) and keep going

Eventually we come to a building with a monk-looking woman -- Isabella

  

We introduce ourselves and I try to explain our plight to her. She doesn’t really engage or take kindly to us being here, and is pretty dismissive, but she tells us there’s a public transit system we can use.

  

TRACK DAYS SINCE JADZIA DIED, we should have about 10

  

Mechanus Prison: 101.101

  

We get Holmgren out easily because Lachlan is in charge, he gets all his stuff back.

  

We have a pointless useless debate over whether or not we should rest because we literally just died and are all injured, or if we should immediately jump right back through some random portal in the middle of nowhere.

  

First the group votes on random portal, but then finally comes to their senses that we should probably do what actually gives us the best shot -- because we don’t really know where any of the portals go (we have a list of cities but have never been) -- we decide to rest the night to let Lachlan’s portal recharge, then we’ll go back to the citadel through it, and trek back to Nythm’Thalas, should be a 4-5 day walk, but its our best option with everything

  

*TRACK KA’LA ON THE WAY*

Peyote Trip

Very quiet cube-room in tavern, no idle chatter or anything, but not very comfortable

Confining but peaceful

Sit and close eyes

See myself in first person walking, city streets, people at market stalls selling wares

A little kid runs up to someone and asks for help, another kid steals someones wallet

I laugh a little, but my laught is not my own. I look down, my hands are not my own, I’m wearing heavy armour

I take something off my face, and now I can’t see, but I feel myself put something down, lay down on my back and face the ceiling

I hear a very very low voice say ‘For order’ and then I wake up

  

I can tell from remembering and a good INT check that **I’m that blind clericy guy from Jerome’s Party**

The city was lush and grassy, clear skies, not some arctic city or forest dwelling ,average people about. Can’t recognize it.

  

Briza also takes peyote and has a vision

Holmgren does something he can do once every 3 days

  

From whatever Holmgren did, he says he knows our weapons have not been destroyed, they’re around somewhere

We wake up and set out -- Lachlan makes his portal back to the land of the living

  

The cavern is empty, everything looks back to normal.

The creature is dead before, looks cutting open, any semblance of a digestive system is missing, seems like Ka’la took it.

  

The other’s are like ‘That bitch! Took our stuff’ but I said that’s basically what we would have done in her case, like party of adventurers goes missing, maybe dead, and leaves behind a bunch of magical items

  

I see a trail that might correspond to Ka’la, pitons heading down the chasm we crossed that she came out of.

  

As I climb, Briza jumps with feather fall, Holmgren jumps with his wings, but because he is incapable of making good choices, they give out and he falls to his death.

Jadzia’s bag of holding tears open.

Briza stabilizes him, and he comes to, tries to gather up his things, tries to remove curse on himself but he’s still weakened.

I continue climbing down.
