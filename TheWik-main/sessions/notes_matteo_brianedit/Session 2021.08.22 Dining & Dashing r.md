So we come back

  

OH FUCK WE ALL LIE AGAIN GODDAMN -- we discussing how to pay, Briza pulls out her diamonds and we talk about using those

---

[[Session 2021.08.22 Dining & Dashing r]] -> [[Nymthalas]] | 2022-01-17
**THEY do not like seeing the diamonds** WARNING FOR NYTHM’THALAS.

---
 Say they wont accept them

We lie saying we don’t have any diamonds, OOPS, lie well enough but that was dumb

  

Vola & Briza go off with Dimitrius to try and sell her jewels

Dimitrius DOES NOT LIKE being called buddy

[[Session 2021.08.22 Dining & Dashing r]] -> [[Thra’maluil]] | 2022-01-17
“Thra’maluil **doesn**’t really like to **make appearances**, not at all. **Only now at the behest of his children**.”

**Thra’maluil** is king of Nythm’Thalas

He does sometimes attend the arena

---


  

  

Something about we’ll pay our debts by fighting in an arena in Nythm’Thalas, maybe against the king? We don’t even need to win or anything apparently, just enter and fight and he’ll make money regardless.

  

It occurred to me I never thought of how to get to the Godvale, just getting to Nythm’Thalas. Winning this arena tournament might be the best way to get an audience with the king.

  

Can’t bring in magical things. Can bring in one magical item, pending approval by [[Scourge the Undying]]. No consumables/potions/etc.

  

FIND SOME SORT OF BANK OR SAFE SPACE TO STORE OUR SHIT

  

We walk for about 7 hours, don’t see or pass anyone. Road progressively narrows, until we come to a massive stone and metal door carved right into a large mountain

  

  

Guards make us pay a ‘visitor’s tax’ (extortion, not real), Briza negotiates it to 20 gp/head. We see the next gate in the distance, within the mountain, also stone, people patrolling the top.

The first 3 gates go through a mountain, [[The Voiceless Summit]]. The rest go out and go higher and higher to give a high ground. Mountainscape up and behind, so Nythm’Thalas is heavily defensible built around mountains

---


The gates progressively become more and more heavily guarded, and go from being made of stone to steel

  

The last gate stands open, series of guards in formation wearing similar armour as Ka’La. One approaches us, she wears clawed shiny gauntlets. She gives us all a big once-over.

[[Session 2021.08.22 Dining & Dashing r]] -> [[Elemmakil]] | 2022-01-17
Elemmakil.

  

She recommends we stay at **The Beautiful Fox,** north of Rimecrest.

She’s not being snarky or anything, but is **amused** like we’re a caricature of foreigner’s visiting.

**She gets us a map**, the guards are very formal and disciplined, but can see they resent little duties like getting a map

[[Session 2021.08.22 Dining & Dashing r]] -> [[Nymthalas]] | 2022-01-17
Gothic-elvish design, very dark, made of black stone and curved marble

Despite the dark aesthetic the city has a liveliness about it, markets and guilds

Given elves have dark vision, city is sort of darker than a typical city.

  

Lots of elves around, some of other races, but NO DWARVES <3

---


  

Arena is a big coliseum right in the middle of town, surrounded by an iron fence and gate, some dudes chilling in the fields. Covered in a glass dome, artistic stuff on the bars

**[[Ash & Dust Arena]]**

  

---

[[Session 2021.08.22 Dining & Dashing r]] -> [[Scourge the Undying]] | 2022-01-17
As we enter arena is very echoey, and there’s a whistling tune

We need to talk to **Scourge the Undying -- basically a Hylek**

A very small green frog dude steps out with a walking stick with braided leafs around it.

  

His mother is there too, also named Scourge, she has a blue cookie tin (probably for sewing)

He’s quite nice and very excited to sign us up

[[Session 2021.08.22 Dining & Dashing r]] -> [[Nymthalas]] | 2022-01-17
Nythm’Thalas is a bureaucracy

---


We can keep our stuff in the arena.

  

In the individual fight, make sure to kill Briza first.

  

---

[[Session 2021.08.22 Dining & Dashing r]] -> [[Kala]] | 2022-01-17
I ask if Ka’la ever comes by -- he looks to his mom and says something in their frog language, -- then he says she comes by sometimes but it wouldn’t really appropriate for her to fight because she’s a general, so mostly like because she’s a professional soldier not really a fair fight.

Good to know thought **Kala Ka’la** is still around, and is a **general** -- maybe promoted after she recovered those artifacts.

---


  

---

[[Session 2021.08.22 Dining & Dashing r]] -> [[Penelope]] | 2022-01-17
**Penelope** is one of the favourites

---


  

We sign up and then make our way to the [[Beautiful Fox Tavern]] -- the decor is mostly taxidermy crows and animals and things, lavishly laid out drug bars and stuff.

  

  

So we have the evening in the tavern, Jadzia will arrange the rooms. We have the evening and one day before the fight, things for Varenzai to do:

## Things for Varenzai to do

**IN TAVERN**

-   Try to casually chat about the Godvale like a tourist
    
-   Ask if anyone ever leaves the city or see if there are any other outsiders
    
-   Chat someone up, make a friend?
    
-   [[DOOMBLOOM]] Jerome
    

**NEXT DAY**

-   Sell things like magic dagger I picked up -- I give dagger to Briza, she gives me
    
    -   Small gnome woman looks at it for me for 10gp. Probably worth 8’000-10’000 GP, it’s a VERY NICE Emerald. I try to ask her to direct me somewhere I could get the best price for
        
    
-   Look around
    
    -   Temple to [[Melora]] or other plant/nature god, or get a sense of that in the city
        
    -   Find a library, books on dragons on the godvale or anything
        
-   STUFF FOR [[AURENE]]
    
    -   Leatherworker -- make her a harness to carry her with
        
    -   Get her a toy or something, maybe some kind of doll or chew toy?
        
    -   MEAT
        
    -   Bag of Colding?
        

  

We end here basically giving a list of things we want to do

  

==DON’T FORGET TO TALK TO PARTY ABOUT [[VOID DRAGONS]] MAYBE==
