Clay notes: basically this is what happened

Briza opens box

Sleepy time

Briza vs. Lachlan grudge match

Holmgren throws briza

Holmgren responsibly moves the sleeping members of the party to a safe location and keeps their body temperatures up, makes coffee

Varenzai wanders off to talk to a fucking sentient pinecone

Talks to a flower

Thinks he’s a super cool nature guy- first instinct is to rip it out of the ground

Fucks up ripping it out, ensuring its slow demise

Thinks he should nurture it in remnants of oil

  

Briza opened her music box and put everyone except Varenzai to sleep, fights with Lachlan over it

  

We seem to be in the some other plane or something, some sort of illusory world.

NOTE TO NOTE: Jadzia is very touchy about saying ‘she works for a demon/knows demonology’

  

White blue tentacles of light

Pinecone people

Flower

  

We went to some dream realm in the cave and all saw visions, super traumatising for everyone except Varenzai, he had a great vision of reuniting with Thera.

  

Varenzai Vision: Godvale tree, fall through to Faelar, find Thera there, purple beetle with red spots

Holmgren Vision: Wartime, soldiers massacring a village

GUNNAR

  

Sacrifice Oblation Immolation

  

  

Holmgren dun goofed -- in the vision we learned Jadzia had been engaged to by Gunner, a noble from the East, but turned him down publicly -- the diamond she had given Holmgren was from this ring, that he had chopped up and not told her. They’re not talking about this.

  

Varenzai offers to keep scouting the cavern to find people’s lost items, we stumble upon a Gnoll ambush
