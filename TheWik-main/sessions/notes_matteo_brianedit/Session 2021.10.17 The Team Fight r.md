We’re quickly skipping through the next two days between the individual fight and the team fight. Varenzai will essentially be doing what I messaged Meg about, shopping, looking for things in the city, and mostly trying to figure out how to see the Court and get to the [[Godvale]]

Also want to continue to be asking around about Kala, see if I can track her down -- right she’s a general now.

[[Session 2021.10.17 The Team Fight r]] -> [[Godvale]] | 2022-01-17
## Asking about the Godvale

Getting an audience with the [[Royal Family]] would probably be my only hope

They used to be really closed off and shut-in. Wouldn’t see just anyone, and the wait-list is years long.

Only way to really be able to be seen would be to know someone, ‘Grease the right wheels’, or bribe/have some other way in.

Winning a tournament or some similar deed would be ‘more than a step in the right direction’

  

## Pre-Fight

I ask Jadzia about the quest, if she’s tried to contact Jerome. She says she hasn’t and isn’t really sure what to do after the Coronet here.

  

Briza ‘amps us up’ by making fun of us all

## Into the Fray

We raise up to the roaring crowd through a similar sort of elevator. Instead of darkness there’s an intense light and heat through the entrance grate.

LAVA ARENA

  

There seem to be many teams, coming out from different sides of the arena. To our left, a bunch of tiny flying creatures.

To our right, goblins & bugbears on some team.

  

**Team NAmes:**

==Before we have a chance to do anything, Briza introduces us as ‘The Melvakars’==

We also hear:

-   The Honey Badgers
    
-   The Scarlet Death
    
-   The Butterflies

One of the fairies polymorphs Briza into a turtle, another hunter’s mark and hits me.

Lachlan casts some hell-pit on the goblins

The goblin dudes start charging over but a spell misses.

  

I shoot the goblins and Vola acids them

Turt-Briza bites Vola
