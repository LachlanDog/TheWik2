Started off from necrotic lair, tried to finish scouting gates of large sewer chamber, this was ultimately a waste of time.

Proceeded down through sewers, eventually found some weird chamber with clean water as opposed to bad icky sewer water.

Fought some aberattion tentacle moster in here (didn’t belong here, how did it get here?) Was already injured.

Ley’Ara -- Full-elf found in the rooms, she was kinda mysterious and not forthcoming. Got along well with Varenzai, took Fairy he found to save her. Varenzai gave her a healing potion.

She said there were two alligators (that’s what fought the tentacle monster) but then they ‘poofed’ away. We rested, she went on her way and we went on ours.

We seemed to find boss chamber next and triggered an attack from a hydra.
