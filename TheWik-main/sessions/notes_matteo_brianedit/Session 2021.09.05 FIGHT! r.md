We starting right at the Arena Solo Fight.

We go over basic rules and questions and stuff first.

  

Basically just massive fight, tons of fun

Varenzai immediately almost goes down in terrible situation surrounded by PENELOPE and some rogue. Lachlan spares him from Slow so he gets away and hides in a tower -- INVESTIGATE CHEST IN THERE

  

Vola paralyzed, Holmgren stunned for a while

Varenzai found a quiver with 10 explosive arrows, and a regular shortbow
