# Session: 22.11.2020: TPK maybe

  

Lots of large Gnolls with spears, and smaller ones with intricate patchwork cloaks

One small one in back has completely white eyes and casts mean spells

  

Combat -- Holmgren kicks ass while the rest of us are relentlessly harassed and roll shit

Vola gets Banished

Mega Toad consumes

Varenzai quadruple kills with Lightning Arrow.

LACHLAN DOES CREEPY MAGIC SHIT WTF

Jadzia wastes a gnoll with blight

  

Fwoosh wind feathers

Big furry thing with lots of decoration

Lots of gnolls coming from cave

  

A roc circles the battlefield, a MASSIVE bear with beads in fur and magicky orb-like eyes enters the fray and helps kill Gnolls

  

LACHLAN GOES FULL NECROMANCER

  

The giant bear fucks shit up, but also messes up Jadzia, Briza seems to recognize it and yells out [SOME NAME] No!

  

Holmgren is bloodthirsty, smearing blood on his tabard and drowning in a pool to appease his Bitch God Umberly.

  

Varenzai gets an epic shot and destroys a gnoll

Vola gets picked up by the Roc, we try to rescue

  

Varenzai makes a fool of himself trying to pacify the Roc, and gets picked up by it

Holmgren vapourizes the roc freeing Varenzai

The bear fights Lachlanâ€™s Zombies as Briza tries to stop the fighting and we end
