Still in Ko’Themar

Recap: Holmgren and Lachlan went to the Sylvan Odeum, Holmgren was immediately like ‘what’s the cult about?’ and they got kicked out,

  

Heading to the hellhound borough to a) have a fight with that angry old dwarf, b) lachlan meets with his mystery person at the brothel and c) secret rat plan

  

Vola couldn’t fight because no one actually set up the fight

  

The bookie is named imograr?

Went looking for Lachlan’s brothel, went down a mysterious alley. Found some strange immaculately simple door, bribed our way in. Was very beautiful inside.

Eida Shadowquick: Ko’Themar council spymaster, new to council wants this dude killed, he’s in prison

-   The Veil: Some sort of cult in Ko’Themar that Eida wants us to look into, they do all kinds of awful things but she wants us to look into them.
    
-   Grayson Orthak: Bad guy in prison who the veil wants to break out -- she wants us to stop their attempt before it happens
    

  

Taking up the job for Lachlan and Holmgren: Going to Sylvan Odeum where they got kicked out for calling it a cult: Looking into references of ‘Gloria’

-   Gloria: Human, brown hair in braids, seamstress for Sylvan Odeum
    
    -   Been at Odeum about a year, does their laundry and seamstressing -- they stressed she’s there by choice
        
    -   She seemed a little sad about it, said she had wanted to continue her studies and was really interested in magic
        
    -   School didn’t work out for her -- other classmates weren’t so nice
        
        -   “Sometime people aren’t good to you and don’t know when to stop -- you have to know when to get away from those people”
            

Get Flowers to Heal Children: Large Flying monstrosity they can’t recognize (not a dragon) flying is guarding some special magical flowers they need to cure people (healing salve) -- haven’t been able to get the flower because of this creature so they need someone to clear it.

Descending into the sewers:

-   When we went to see Davide he gave us all flowers -- these were the EXACT SAME flowers that Tora had that she had said she bought for herself -- she blushed when I noticed and questioned Davide
    
-   Blindfolded and taken to sewers by anonymous male henchman -- Davide followed along -- did so playfully with Tora
    
-   Davide: Involved with lots of stuff, but seems like a nice good genuine guy. Likes to be in control
    
-   Lead us to sewers, said to go kill beasty, but avoid arcane symbols/runes (these are probably protecting someone/something)
