Morning Conversations in the Inn:

-   Holmgren decides he wants to go talk to Daveed about Tora (even though we already did this, fiiiiiiiine)
    
-   Briza decides disguise herself and cast Nondetection, Disguise self -- we’ll keep her resurrection hidden for now
    
-   We talk a lot about murder theories and Company Zero vs the Veil in front of the crew -- was Briza assasinated in revenge for the veil because she wasn’t protected, or because she saw the book but didn’t sign
    
-   Lorca asks what’s so special about going over the mountain, ‘it’s dangerous over there’, we kinda say a few things eventually Lachlan says ‘we’re like bodyguards for our friend and she wants to get over’.
    

  

**Split The Party: Encore!**

Airship crew goes shopping for the Banquet I think?

Holmgren, Vola, & Briza decide to go see Daveed

-   They get to the shop, Merchant’s district look all closed but Daveed is in his shop and goes up to door when they knock
    
-   Holmgren says ‘I may have delivered the letter for the meteors’, he seems like why would you say this just in the street (and he probably already knows given Ly’Ara gave Holmgren the letter), so he brings them in store
    
-   Sees through Briza’s disguise
    
-   Briza: “so you know what happened to me?” D: “Well you look a little rough there kid.” B “Do you know why” D “Do you” B “I asked you first” D “You’re In my store” B ”Touche. We have theories, things of that nature”
    
-   Daveed insinuates Varenzai’s theory about the assasination was right -- that the Veil are going after us, but he can protect us from them if we sign his book. Because Briza didn’t sign, she’s not protected.
    
-   Daveed insinuates Tora is very shady, has asked Holmgren why we’re with her anyways and when Holmgren said he loves her ‘There’s plenty of other people out there.’
    
-   Daveed: “No one ever says they’re working with Tora, or plenty do but they’re never right. She only has people working for her.”
    
-   He stresses again as Holmgren asks that he has no idea where Tora was
    
-   Vola asks if Daveed’s family is ok and he very shortly responds ‘they’yre fine’ thus bringing full circle to Varenzai’s earlier conversation with Daveed
    

Varenzai & Lachlan go looking for Calli again

-   We get to the gate, same levels of chaos and stuff, I advise Lachlan to ask the guards for Calli while I look around
    
-   Lachlan is unsuccessful but Varenzai manages to spot her:
    
    -   Short gnomish woman, wearing nice bright yellow doublet, holding sack of papers and fliers and quills, taking notes
        
-   She’s very nice and very helpful, remembers helping a fancy dragonborn
    
-   Told him to go to brightcastle
    
-   GILDED PILLOW
    
-   We thank her profusely and each tip her a platinum piece, she gives us a 5% off coupon and invites us to tea
    

  

We meet back up

They rely to us that they got nothing from Daveed (except that Varenzai’s Theory was probably right), and we relay to them that we found where Bolero was staying. They don’t really relay their concerns about Tora.

We try to figure out how to get into Bright Castle and the inn. Lachlan suggests he could disguise himself as Bolero then ride my shoulders to look the part.

Holmgren was concerned they wouldn’t let us in, restricting movement within the city, but then why would Calli tell us we could stay at the Gilded Pillow.

We go to Kira’s Habadasherie and Clothing (Dress lady Lachlan met a while ago) -- get clothes for Brightcastle and for banquet while we figure out next steps

She gets us nice clothes, including specially fitted some for Thera, and a Tabard for Holmgren to put over his armour

  

Holmgren doesn’t know what god he worships -- Lachlan reveals it’s Umberlee (The Bitch Queen), an evil sea goddess -- destructive and vengeful to both those who love and hate her.

  

Briza & Lachlan dimension door into the Brightring District, and Varenzai, Thera, Vola, & Holmgren go in through the gate and the guards make fun

  

Debate over what to do and where to go next: Mrs. S or the Inn, should Briza tell Mrs. S everything or not?

Private Conversation we don’t hear between Briza and Lachlan

Lachlan pulls Briza aside and successfully casts Suggestion on her to not talk about Company Zero

  

Foyer of Mrs. S’

Penny is still there making her tea and stuff

-   Nemiza asks to speak with Mrs. S, he asks where’s Briza
    
-   I tell him Briza’s dead, he’s distraught
    
-   Nemiza insinuates she’s ok, ‘she’s closer than you think’.
    
-   Penny gets very upset that I briefly said Briza was dead but brings us up to see Mrs. S
    
-   We try to get Mrs. S up to speed on what we know, explain Briza was assassinated because we investigated the Veil and then went to Daveed for protection and she’s like WTF
    
-   Then Holmgren reveals to us all that he delivered the letter and she gets terrified and furious because that’s the catalyst that kills everyone, kicks us all out except Briza
    
-   She also admits that Ox Bellows is bad but won’t say much, says she’s working with him to protect someone she loves
    
-   She has a private conversation with Briza, worries she’s gonna get fired, basically admits that Ox Bellows is a human trafficker does kidnapping and stuff to accomplish his ends
    
-   THERE ARE NO GOOD GUYS
    

  

After this, we go to the Gilded Pillow to investigate Bolero

At the Gilded Pillow

-   We walk in, Holmgren very unsuccessfully tries to bribe the receptionist, but Vola talks our way in -- she says Bolero has been there, but someone new is staying in his room
    
-   They let us up, the room is: 6th floor, 10 doors down from elevator -- I give a great tip to the person who brought us to give us time
    
-   Holmgren teleports in and leaves us outside, doesn’t convey anything
    
-   Inside is Zanzibar, they talk a bit, she says something about getting rid of things entangling Holmgren so he’s free to go with her
    
-   Briza finally picks the lock after ~10 mins and we bust in. Zanzibar runs, in the next room we see a blonde woman (not Tora) who looks scarred and very beaten. We find Tora’s scimitar there too. We end here.6
