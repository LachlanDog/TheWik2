# Session: 17.01.2021: Briza’s Body

Vola med checks the body we found. She finds a ceremonial looking dagger on it, and the throat is slit, looks self-inflicted

The body seems to be 120~130 years old

This gnome was about ~450 years old when died, skin has turned grey but seemed to originally be the same colour as Briza’s, a bit shorter than Briza but probably because of age. Faded ring line

We find books on her desk opened to a page, its written in celestial then common then gnomish. Titled Vorgrims Frozen Tempest, crossed out and retitled Vorgrims Grimoire of Echoes. There was also a Journal.

  

There are drawers and a trunk in the room that are not locked.

  

Kala recognizes the body but is toying with us, not for any evil or bad reason but just because its more of a game to her. She found a glass crystal-ball thing, probably her orb.

  

Trunk has stuff, a bag of evil, a snowglobe, a black torch and maybe others

  

Holmgren tries to ninja loot the chest but Jadzia catches him and calls him out.

  

The ring has the name inscribed inside of it: Briza Vorgrim

  

Lachlan investigates the tank, Kala found the orb beside it. It has a sort of salty liquid inside, we determine it’s the right size and properties that it could have potentially been used to grow a body!

  

  

The Journal:

Mostly celestial at beginning, then common, last part in gnomish

Earliest writings were from ~240 second era (Currently 869). Writings are interspersed with runic, over time there’s a notable shift of the handwriting going from beautiful cursive to printing to chicken scratch, and less detailed. Written in many different colours and inks

  

Lachlan has a bit of a back and forth with Kala about what she’s up to

She says:

The orb belongs to Nythm’Thalas, as do I, I am returning it. Many thought it was here but it was difficult to get to.

She denies that it relates to her trials in the Godvale, says she has no desire to be tested there.

  

Holmgren plays around with a puzzle box he found, Kala does as well, then gives it to Jadzia who doesn’t know wtf to do with it. She hands it to Briza and it immediately opens.

It contains:

A fancy dagger

A sickle!!!

An orange-sized heart thing

5 ornate gems (not diamonds, but very fancy gems)

A tiny sword that grows into a greatsword as it comes out, it’s VERY black

  

Before this keep was taken by the Frost Giants it was the fortress of a Cloud Dragon.

  

  

King had a queen who died. Court of stars, with different leaders, but the king is the king, and his word is law. -- what the fuck does this mean, past Matteo?

  

WRITE A SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS FROM BRIZA’S JOURNAL

This is her third incarnation?

She got the Coronet (artifact we were looking for) for the king from the Godvale, fitted it for the queen. She originally exchanged her shadow to the Godvale, but no one could recognize or see her, so she went back and gave it her mind instead. -- or as in no one could remember her, she left no shadow, no trace

She was in love with the royal princess, but cut out her --[the princesses? Or her own?--see below, was heart of the queen] heart and gave her dreams to the ‘tree’.

When she came back out the second time she eventually went to the Bodr Mountains (here)? Ley lines and vault.

  

# What Varenzai knows about the Feywild

‘A shadow over this place, magical place’ Leylines from here cross over to this world.

Courts of the seasons (Spring, Summer, Winter, Fall)

Briza stole the heart from the queen of the winter court

It’s where Varenzai’s people are now.

  

  

  

Godvale is a door to where I need to be or give what I need (if worthy) to get Thera back -- it’s not like a prison where she’s trapped or something that took her soul, it’s essentially a door or connection to the Feywild in a sense, but in a wishing well give you what you need put you where you need to be for a price.

RE Leyline Crisis, people misunderstand, foolish to think you could tame a place in the Feywild for your own.

Theory: It’s my people’s fault Thera didn’t come back this time, when she died her spirit went back to Elysia through the Leylines because it’s in the Feywild now.

  

Fuck so I gotta figure out what’s going on, what the significance of the Godvale here is, why my ritual with Thera failed, what the leylines mean, and what’s going on.

  

Rooms full of humanoid sized corpses

  

Runes along the wall, iconography dragon and lunar

A lot of the bodies are not tossed around or in the middle of doing something, they’re all laying in bed in their cots like they died lying there.

What is on their skeletal remains is very simple, like this is a temple -- seems like this was a temple to Bahamut once, but based on the stories told in the pictures this isn’t the original Bahamut as I know it but some different sect.

There is one picture in particular that a lot of the stories and images lean to, and it looks like a fabric carved into the stones

  

1 person per room in rooms with bodies

  

Weird session lots of stuff happened, gonna have to sort through it all.

--oops, forgot to fill this in again.

Kala knows a lot and was generally helpful in the end, if withholding.

  

**FIRESIDE STUFF:** Implication is if Varenzai got banished he would return to the Feywild → FILL THIS IN WITH WHAT I LEARNED FROM ASKING MEG QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT VARENZAI KNOWS ABOUT HISTORY!!!

  

# Session-EARLY: 28.03.2021: The Trials Commence

Setting: Forest near Sime Tolic

Can’t fully change the present, but this will have some conequences

  

Not one person considered ‘pope’

Some gods considered much more popular, generally those associated with agriculture: ‘melora, pelor, the sun’, melora is more chill, followers of pelor are much more strict, they do have local leaders but it doesn’t go all the way up to a pope or like one person who the god ‘speaks through’.

  

  

Varenzai is making his way to Sime Tolic from the coast

While going, came upon a small forest, completely taken aback by how beautiful it was

Absolutely beautiful, like something from a fairy tale

However as I was going through, I came across several dead bodies -- doesn’t look like a fight or struggle, they were just chilling -- maybe poisoned or instant-killed.

Eventually, found a small firbolg community -- I learned it’s because EVERYTHING in the forest is poisonous

  

**Daear:** In the forest 1000’s of years -- not worship exactly, but lots of reverence to a particular old and large oak tree growing in a spiral shape

Very friendly community, no creepy vibes just inviting Varenzai to stay with them, wanting to both protect the forest but also people going through it.

The tree has a sort of ‘living handprint’ on it, they tell me to put my hand on it, and I feel a sorty of heartbeat

  

I’ve made friends here, they’re not hostile but they seem on edge -- strange occurences, like people talking to no-one etc., they kinda play it down, it’s not part of the forest but something else, community wants to be private and not influenced by outsiders

  

Eventually I learn it’s a ghost! Ghost only started haunting them recently and it’s been worse and worse until everyone in the community saw it.

A few weeks ago, it seemed to be trying to communicate with people and ‘cursing them’ -- they pass through a person, and then they get an affliction, but it seems random but there’s not just one thing, everyone gets something different

Ghost is humanoid, I caught glance of it, tall and thin, human or half-human at one point

Strange bluish red-tinge at the end of it’s spectral form

I’ve started to try to communicate with this fellow

Ghosts in this world are pretty rare but not unheard of, especially rare one that sticks around.

People communicated with have found **out ghost is missing something, and wants it back to rest -- it wants a ring.**

Seems to leave a recurring thought of this, not just the madness, this is the common denominator linking people.

Desperation feeling, not domination

Ring: Gold, with little ruby, very simple.

People keep repeating: salt-licker (PEACHES?!) -- people seemed much more afraid of that than anything with the ghost

Saltlicker was the last name of a family/creature that lived in a forest -- some call a hag, other says that was just said to insult

Saltlicker, one way or another, seems to have this ring.

  

The firbolgs can’t leave the forest, and much moreso they don’t want to go to the bone forest -- plants do not grow there, it’s bone and ash, and lots of undead -- big air of necromatic energy around the entire bone forest

Bone forest is the kind of place where people say on the outside it’s just like a patch of trees, but when you’re in it seems endless -- spooky forest

  

  

  

QUESTIONS:

**Am I first of my kind they’ve seen --**

**Timeline, am I part of our own party** -- This is before finding/forming party, when Varenzai is in exile wandering the land looking for work

**Have I seen a ghost before** -- from where Varenzai comes from, no such thing, considered extremely unnatural, the ultimate perversion of natural order, reinforces the feeling that the ghost is trapped -- ghosts form from that kind of unfinished business, revenge, wrongly killed, one story of a ghost haunting an area because they were confused because they didn’t have their glasses and they needed their glasses everyday to read stories to their adopted daughter

**Undead vs. ghosts** -- I figure there is some way that these are connected, necromancers draw on the same kinds of energies and forces

  

  

I was given a vague strange set of directions through the bone forest. The sentiment is I was told what I’m looking for, in here there’s only one place to go, one structure.

  

Walking in, the bright beautiful day suddenly turns gloomy and sad, no clouds that kinda appeared, but a sense of big heaviness

  

Crunching through, walking on bones and ash and a strange mixture of things, cough and not feel why

  

After a few hours of travelling like this, I see the outline of the structure -- a large 3 or 4 storey church, very decrepit (HIDE AND OBSERVE)

  

Small tiny window slits that let in a tiny amount of light -- brief perimeter, single entrance, large circular stone door

  

I spend a minute doing primeval awareness -- thought it would be a nice easy minute, but it just drags on and on and on, I eventually finish and detect no humanoids in 5 miles.

  

I don’t perceive people having been around, like footprints or anything -- I do note a lot of gravestones around the church, it looks like some of them were once gathered together, a set put there purposefully, and then more added over time, peppered around, so the church has a whole slew of graves around it -- don’t even seem like graves at first, just simple marker’s like a walk.

  

Each epitaph is very different, all kinds of scripts.

  

We feel pretty stealthy walking through and around.

  

Door has no handle -- carving of snakes -- lever next to it that looks like it operates the door

  

As I was walking around and scouting I did notice sound from this place, odd sounds -- wave my hand and a bug goes by, or like a ‘skittering’ -- but there were no bugs in the rest of this forest

Kind of annoying, the one I swatted was trying to bite, Thera seems similarly uneasy.

  

Snake carvings seem important on door.

After 10 seconds or so after pulling lever, the door begins to open -- walls are VERY THICK like a fortress

  

It’s completely very dim, I can see in with my darkvision

Place is destroyed, full of debris, all sorts of moth-eaten fabrics

Dim light makes it hard to see details of everything, but I feel like I should be able to see further than I can

  

History check on snake imagery: serpent gods in general, are often associated with hearing a hissing voice in their head that calls to people, all the ones I’ve ever heard is that they were imprisoned a long time ago beyond the border of hte world for doing *something*. Some stories say they broke free, other stories are they’re still imprisoned but powerful enough to bewitch from prison, all about seduction and bewitching, but taking more than they give

  

We stealthily advance pew by pew, I check around and see that the walls of the stone room are filled with different sized paintings:

Paintings are all of faces of different people, regal, family-potrait type vibes, serious looking. All different kinds of races, humans and elves and such

As the rooms go on the paintings change, looking more grotesque, like features drawn out of proportions and exaggerated until they appear demonesque,

  

This is definitely a kind of magical darkness, light (except by magical means) would probably not have an effect, I’m not seeing more as I go further in

  

As I make my way through, there are bones everywhere, just like outside in the forest.

  

But, a pile of bones in front seems especially unique -- no felsh, just bone, but the skeleton looks like it had fallen and sunk into the floor, and parts are sticking up, like it phased through into the ground, it goes right through carpet and floor

  

Another skeleton by a painting almost seems to be trying to reach out of the wall, half it’s body is trapped in

  

As I investigate these bones, I hear like a moist rubbing sort of schloopy sound coming from the two braziers in front of me, not getting closer or anything -- the braziers themselve are made of flesh, fused together, like parts of people, but smoothly together -- there’s some movement to them, built into the floor.

  

The braziers are filled with coals, but doesn’t look like they’ve been lit recently.

  

The skin shows pocks and scabs and scars where it’s maybe been burned.

  

A wooden chandelier almost crushes me but I dodge out of the way.

I hear a strange wooden knock at the front door, which has closed.

I go to climb the stairs, they all look fine and super normal, some dust everywhere, so doesn’t look

  

As I climb the stairs, my feet start to feel a bit sticky to the floor and hand to the wall -- wall looks like a normal clean wall, and normal floor, but my feet and hands seem covered in blood -- seems related to the stairwell

  

Second floor -- portraits in different kinds of frames and such, still grotesque -- the only thing that’s really here that doesn’t seem destroyed

  

The knocking continues intermittently, in all kinds of different ways, different rhythms and noises and such. No clear pattern,

  

As soon as we get to second floor, the knocking suddenly stops -- didn’t want me to go up here? Or a warning not to?

  

Second floor, some sort of balcony space to the second floor.

  

More portraits on the walls here, but these ones are already grotesque, getting worse

  

Sharp sudden knockknockknock that scares me as I enter second floor. Wood floor is creaky here

  

I decide to check out one of the paintings -- tiefling woman, 2 horns on curling up other down -- skin is purpley and freckled with something like white freckles, very beautiful but hands gripping head like she has a terrible migraine or she’s trying to stop something from getting inside, eyes closed wincing in pain. She’s sitting, hunched.

  

After a little delay, it looks like where I touched the painting rippled through it. It shifts, and the woman is now splitting the flesh off her head.

  

I light the painting on fire -- it looks like a slow stop-motion animation, static images blink in, I never see it change, it just changes as it goes. It burns very well but not quickly. As it burns a horrifying stop-motion show appears, as I watch the person slowly burn to death. She looks out, seeming to make eye contact with me, then falls over, seemingly dead.

  

Portrait next to that one catches fire, I manage to beat it out with my blanket. Whereas the last portrait looked like she was in a lot of pain, this portrait of 2-elves looks like they’re in great fear, like something is crawling under their skin.

I reach out and cast cure wounds on the painting, looking for a reaction, seems to be no effect.

  

CHECK THE PORTRAIT ON THE OTHER SIDE BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE

  

Wall here doesn’t have blood effect of stairwell, but I do leave bloody footprints now.

  

I put out remaining portrait fires, knocking continues and seems to be getting more frantic. Stairwell still has creepy weird blood effect. I go up to third floor and it’s very similar to where I just was.

These paintings are much worse than the ones from before, these are abominations, like creatures fused with people, very unnatural and awful.

  

  

Knocking has stopped.

Groaning, creaking of floor as I walk on it, almost instinctual to keep hand on a wall because it does not seem structurally sound.

  

Looking up from here, seems I’m fairly close to ceiling, next floor is top highest. More wooden chandeliers. The ceiling is like a very black stone. Move torch a little and the light seems to almost glitter and gleam off of it in an iridescent way. It’s not stone but the ceiling is FILLED with bugs, some like beetler coating it completely reflecting the light back

  

Fourth floor, more paintings and such, a lot of these paintings have holes and massive tears in it, no figures in them, like they weren’t paintings of anything. Some of them look wet from far away.

  

  

As I check it out, I hear a screech from below -- THERA! A bony ragged hand reaches out of nowhere and swipes at her.

It disappears then swipes her again, she looks very disoriented and something wrong

  

A metallic movement, a voice says ‘WHAT?!’ and coughing from above on the fourth floor, a kind of hacking. And then buzzing.

Thera is cured of her blindness and we go to main campaign

  

# Session-Normal.03.2021: The Ice Fortress

Refresher -- Holmgren found a broom, Briza is dancing with corpses, Lachlan is throwing up and Vola is holding his ears back, Kala and Varenzai are milling about.

  

As we come in we are immediately ambushed by Ice elementals, Jadzia had noticed it was getting colder, start picking away at them.

Midway through the start of the fight, we here some weird awful grinding noise rom far off, and something seems to change? Not sure what.

The ground is shaking, almost a pulling sort of noise -- Briza and I see some horrible abomination dragging itself out of the depths, its massive and black and has a lot of teeth -- a fog follows it, it looks like a giant, but all smooth shrouded blackness, its gut is open in a massive maw with tons of teeth. They smell really bad.

  

The thing charges me and fucking eats kudzu!!!! Briza deploys the anti-magic ball, does nothing but block our own spells.

I try diving in after kudzu, am unsuccessful and it just spits me back out, and then the madness commences.

  

Some wild magic effects start going off as we cast the spells.

A bunch of trees are summoned, they are covered in mouths and help us kill the ice elementals, before singing to put us to sleep maybe? They’re trying in any case.

  

I try to cast conjure animals, but the wild magic makes me turn into a potted plant (RACISM!?). Jadzia’s shadow disconnects from her and becomes a shadow monster.

A different effect goes off and our consciousness all transfers around our bodies:

Varenzai → Vola → Briza → Jadzia → Lachlan → Holmgren → Varenzai

  

Holmgren in Varenzai remains a potted plant

The evil demon thing (Tomb skulker or something) tries to eat Vola’s new sword but she succeeds the check and hangs on.

  

Demons summoned, Jadzia dead

Monster kills Vola

Lachlan retreats into the Mechanus portal with Varenzai Body.

  

Kala comes back

  

As it eats Holmgren’s sword, Briza’s Maw Demon chomps it and kills it!

  

We end up in Mechanus, Vola brought back, but all her items gone
