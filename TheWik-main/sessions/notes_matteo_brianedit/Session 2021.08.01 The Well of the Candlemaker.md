The queen has agents in the feywild, but it’s not clear if they can cross realms

We get back started, mostly just talk about life and then general stuff we’ve been up to

We talk about our special weapons, Holmgren didn’t get one lmao

-   Holmgren gets nothing
    
-   Lachlan has a mysterious box and egg
    
-   Briza gets a winged wand
    
-   Vola gets a fancy maul ([[Heaven’s Gavel]])
    
-   Varenzai gets an amazing super-awesome bow ([[Arc of the Alicorn]])
    

They all have similar motifs in design and appearance

Vola’s has imagery of unicorns and dragons

  

Right at entrance of a thick dark forest, faint motes of light within it, presumably from the candlemaker (confirmed by Erna)

  

After a long and exhausting discussion about purely hypothetical situations, we FINALLY have Erna summon the candlemaker -- he rubs his back up against a tree like a bear might, shaking it

  

Eventually we see the candlemaker approach

  

Candlemaker comes, we see tons of small lights approach through the dark forest. He’s covered in all sorts of jingle jangling baubles. Candles light behind him in his wake as he walks past

  

OF NOTE -- he’s not some Oakheart-esque giant like I thought, he’s Briza sized

  

## Into the Forest

Only light we can see in the forest is candles, everything else is choked out, very very dark. The deeper we get, there is far less density of candles

  

Feels like the forest is sleeping

  

As the candlemaker walks, he turns around, taps his footsteps where he was walking as though a reminder to follow, and then keeps going

  

His mouth feels full of burn/scorch marks

  

As we walk Lachlan asks me if I see anything, I do perception

PERCEPTION CHECK

-   “Smell it before I see it” -- as we follow it gets stronger and stronger and more pungent -- smells like rotting
    

  

As we keep going, very few candles at this point on the path we’re on

As we go, Candlemaker holds up hand to stop -- we see a human-looking figure about 15-20’ off the path, impaled on a poleaxe, gashed and lacerated, intestines pouring out, eyeballs missing

  

CANDLEMAKING

The surrounding area almost seems decorated with the gore

Candlemaker approaches it, starts cutting off some of the skin and fat of the body, sticks hand right in, pulls out bloody hand, puts hand together, twists them as if wringing out a rag, opens hand and there is a candle.

Leans down and places it to the path on one side.

As Varenzai watched him, it’s not like he was specifically taking certain parts of the body, not specifically going for any organs or fatty tissues, more just generally hacking away

  

Clay shows us Marco is once again on a door

  

Body was likely killed maybe 1 day ago or so, seems fresh  
  

## Bird Attack

Briza goes to body we find, after the candlemaker leaves it. She tries to loot it, rip stuff off.

Candlemaker walks off

Briza continues to loot and gets viciously attacked by a big flock of awful birds

I can see that her wounds are already turning black, the fleshing dying around where they peck

NOW WE FIGHT

  

Candlemaker continues to walk away and fades into the distance

Varenzai tries to keep following him, hits a bird, it flinches but doesn’t go down, like a normal bird would

  

BRIZA DIED AGAIN WTF -- once again the brilliant planning and foresight and unity of the party leads us to great success, instead of resting and preparing before entering the forest, or just simply sticking to and following the candlemaker

  

  

Turn timers (s)

Holmgren: 211, 248, 151

Varenzai: (NULL, Estimate: 122), 108, 135

Vola: 126, 137, (NULL)

Lachlan: 357, 105, (NULL)

  

Jadzia polymorphs Vola into a T-rex which helps us wreck the birds, finally combat ends, Briza is able to be revivified and we resume following the candlemaker and keep going

  

  

## The Cave

After the fight we follow the candlemaker to a cave with a pool in it. He gestures at the water and then leaves, the candles go out behind him.

  

This is the pool to go through to get to the portal back to the material plane, we talk a bit about the best way to get through.

  

Varenzai writes a note on some parchment in sylvan:

“Varenzai, a free Entheri, travelled through here on [Today's Date]. Other free Entheri should please seek out and contact me.”

He leaves this in the cave sealed in a glass bottle.

  

I go over with Aurene in draconic and miming that we need to swim through. She looks down and says back in draconic while also chirping (in the equivalent of a little kid voice in draconic) “food?” -- Essentially her first word

  

We basically need to swim through the pool of freezing water to get to the portal, but run into a big issue -- Because of the goddamned evil artifacts, Briza can’t hold her breath, so can’t go underwater.

  

Although there are several apparent solutions, in typical fashion the party tries to overcomplicate with convoluted spells and issues.

  

IMPORTANT NOTE: Teach Aurene to Swim

  

Vola smartly dives right in and swims well and direct to the portals

The others enact they’re crazy convoluted plan, it goes right off the rails with a series of bad rolls, and we basically roleplay a very drawn out scene of the party drowning

  

Varenzai sits in Jadzia’s bag of holding because even though she would be resistant to the cold we weren’t sure she could swim, and Jadzia wouldn’t let her be in the bag alone.

  

FINALLY eventually the party comes out the other side of the portal, some kind of intense feeling and darkness to brightness, feels like breaking through a surface

  

Hard floor below, marble steamy room, 8-9 people standing around. Most feel exhausted and intense pain of the cold and almost drowning

  

Pop out in a very very fancy bathhouse pool -- SEEMS LIKE we’re finally in Nythm’Thalas

  

## Getting Back

10th Brotok (4th month of year), 872 -- IT WAS FALL OF 869 WHEN WE LEFT WTF

--So its 2.5 years later than when we left.

Vola & Lachlan forget everything about our time in the Feywild, remember leaving in 869, Lachlan and then just poofing back here

So we basically came out in some fancy hoity toity they’re all haughty and are mostly offended that we’re dirtying the place.

Some elves and dragonborn people around, one young one and his father is in charge

They call it a temple and the Relaxation Grotto

They say it’s a half-day’s walk to Nythm’Thalas from here

Politically more of the same, lots of tension between Ko’Themar and Nythm’Thalas, dwarves aren’t welcome there but we should be able to get in

  

They say it’s ‘lent’ right now in Nythm’Thalas, they’re being boring, Brightfather Festival of Spring -- Celebrates Corolon
