## Post-Fight -- Down in the bar

We go downstairs (Holmgren & Jadzia stay upstairs while he puts clothes on) and meet the airship crew huddled around, talk to them

Lorca says I’m unlikely to find any open shops

They say they also want to leave, but are going to wait 2-3 days -- they told the city they’re going to stop trading with them, so don’t want to piss them off further by sneaking out

They ask why Varenzai is so anxious to leave -- he brings up that Thera is no longer there and he has to go find her in the Godvale. We also mention needing to go to Nythm’Thalas but don’t explain why:

  

Court of stars -- Nym’Thalas (This is how **Aerindor** describes Nym’Thalas, navigator of airship)

  

Gryffon tells us the airship can leave in 3 days. Lorca negotiates price with us (she’s awful)

  

  

Thrall tells us this about the godvale:

Thrall is not from this plane, they come from Dream plane

Tree is god, will judge, if good you’ll go where you’re going (some sort of portal connected to dream plane?)

Ulutiu, god of the Godvale tree, God of the Ice and the arctic. Rangers and people who follow the nature of the Arctic worship him

Briza worships Thrin (or at least her Frost Giants do)

  

We eventually arrange:

1000 gold for airship passage

We’ll also perform duties and work on the ship to help while it goes.

Fuck Lorca

  

### Ghyf Letter:

Thrall translates the Ghyf letter for us. It says:

“Grenwold. You’ve said, time and time again, you knew who had this exalted staff, and where they’ve gone. Her patience grows very thin. You wander through these planes like a wildling. Your gift was not given without strings, and they grow taut in her grasp. She... is timeless. You...are timeless. For now. The shadow will follow the boy. Bring him to the divide, or we will. And not without leaving your fate to the voidstones, which will be your only companions. Dictated but not read, Vlaakith CLVII”

  

## To the temple

Varenzai gets fed up with the negotiations, goes to the Plant Temple to Dadriel. Gall, the same human priest who was there last time is there, he’s nice to Varenzai.

Gall doesn’t recall the Godvale directly but says he can bring Varenzai some books tomorrow.

Varenzai meditates on Thera’s memory a bit then takes his Memorial Peyote.

  

## The others

Jadzia writes in a journal

Holmgren plays Bone Dice and drinks with Caius, loses bad

Briza plays flute

Vola tries and fails to summon a rabbit (she must already have found one)

Lachlan asks Nemo some questions, then invites Roxanne to join us on our adventure. She agrees!

  

Briza attuned to the fan.

Holmgren is attuning with the conch.

Vola got a pet pikachu she named Volta.

  

Varenzai meditates and gets high but no other effects like the last time he had peyote, just time dilation and focus. Wakes up at ~1AM, Gall has draped a blanket over him and was asleep under a blanket on a bench. Varenzai wakes him to tell him to go home then returns to the tavern and gets a long rest, then starts reading the Void Dragon book.

## Void Dragon Book

Very old and difficult to understand Elvish. Can study in the 4 hours after my trance each day, but will take 6 weeks of dedicated study just to this book doing that to get any benefit from it.

  

## Paralyzed Vale

Sanctuary there, floating

Past a bunch of frozen lakes (Harrowfrost Plains)

Fortress there, for a god, carved out of an iceberg, the Hall, holds “Spirits of the Damned”

Floating sanctuary and Hall are different, but same place

Barren

# Session: 30.08.2020: All Aboard

## The Airship:

The Stormlight

Dragon Class Aravel Ship

Lots of filigree, ornate metal, dragon imagery as well as other mythology

Lightly to medium armoured -- much more obviously for speed than war

A few heavy cannons on board

  

## Getting Aboard

Vola asks Lachlan and Roxanne a bit about what they’re up to

Volta shocks Vola

Varenzai pets Peaches a bit, Nemo says peaches wants to eat him

  

## First Chat with Aerindor

She seems pleasant enough, knows of Varenzai’s continent and what’s going on there (talk to her about that later).

Was happy and able to provide Varenzai with maps of the arctic and Nythm’Thalas region.

  

Mostly lots of talking and stuff, Briza’s knife got stolen, update about that sometime

  

2 white dragons
