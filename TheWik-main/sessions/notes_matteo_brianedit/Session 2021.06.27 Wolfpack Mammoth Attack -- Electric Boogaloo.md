## Continuing Combat

At the start -- VOLA SMASH

Wolves rush in, miss

Varenzai tries to run around to outside to be able to do *something(anything)*

Darkness in main room

  

Vola tried cheating and used her hammer for a bit before pointing out it gone

  

  

MIDWAY THROUGH THE FIGHT:

Briza decides to open the Antimagic Orb thing -- Urithana and the shadow monsters are caught in the blast -- Urithana transforms into her true form -- A UNICORN

  

I shot a great supercharged arrow at the Ice Monster and slayed it! But it exploded into a million ice shards, damaging me and killing (knocking unconscious) Vola.

  

The goblins spit on me to stabilize me, but it works.

  

We get through most of the fight, one shadow bitch left, Holmgren on the verge of death.
