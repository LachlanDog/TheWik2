We start on my turn -- I investigate to see if the chest is trapped -- the chest is safe but turns out I’m standing on a fucking pressure plate :( So I live here now

  

Vola & Holmgren still stunned

  

  

Vola goes out, then Holmgre, then Briza

Chicken Monk goes out (Aarocockra)

  

Varenzai and Lachlan go out last on the same turn

Holmgren tries hitting Varenzai with a potato

Varenzai goes in and out of the tower a lot, eventually Penelope climbs up, he tries to drop down and away but she finishes him.

  

Then [[Penelope]] finishes Kite and wins! Epic showdown as Penelope corners Kite on a platform, says ‘you could give up’ Kite says ‘no it’s fine, just do it’, and Penelope kicks her off the platform.

[[Session 2021.09.19 The Battle Continues r]] -> [[Penelope]] | 2022-01-17
At the end, Penelope has a clear moment where her Rage drops and then she just straight up drops dead. Some clerics come out and cast Revivify on her without diamonds and she comes back up, crowd keeps cheering as if this is entirely normal.

-- Meg tells us she’s some kind of special CR homebrew barbarian that’s basically invincible.

  

VARENZAI NOTE: GET SLEEPY ARROWS.
