Atmosphere shifting and changing

Combat, I cursed Holmgren, recurse someone else? And then do the heal thing?

Half health?

Briza under bag of holding.

**Spells under 6th level don't work on Rakky


Briza died!

Varenzai went to save. Rakky disapeared

All under bag then?

Briza hear noise... knocking, in her mind.

Pitter patter, floomph, repeat

# Raka


# IRL Inn
Briza wakes up in real world inn??

==Our bag of holding has been turned asunder, that's what was up with dream :O==

Young elf wakes her up, was knocking on the door.

Baby mini mammoth?

Brizas dex is now 4?

Wearing nice armor, kid, looks like he's wearing soldier costume. 

>Elf is holding Varenzais bow [[Kudzu]]??

[[Lonny]] is elf name. Got bow for his birthday. Shelly is his mom

His aunt is [[KALA]], was sent here by her. 

We know her from somewhere? 

Vola wakes up.

Lots of Launy's token wrapped around Kudzo. Weapon charms.

# Being old

Lachlan went from maybe 3-4 to 12? like 20 something to 60's 70s?

May not be.

# Lachlan list
- Most likely confused by dream, would tell others
- **Realizes the collar is gone!**
- His stuff is everywhere...

Kala survived item monster, that's how gave kudzo to dumby.

Notice my collar is gone. Kala sent launy to get us, wasn't supposed to say that apparently?

I search the room. Nothing else taken... who???

Is all our HP set back. 

Launy is a range. 

Person grateful to Kala. 

Asking people have you seen my collar? 

**Holmgren realizes the conch is gone!**

Varenzai congratulates Kala on her promotion?

Kala, says doesn't have my stuff.

- Remind people about the dream w Raksha
	
	Someone went missing in kothemar Varenzai says?

OH yeah kala was saying god vale stuff

Varenzai claims hes fine passing his bow on?? WAAAA??

Briza asks Kala about Vorgrim

Briza changes to look like Nemo

Also Briza woke up exhausted from dying in sleep?

Group finally says we all had same dream.

Lachlan realizes missing collar probably has something o do with Raksha. Maybe lachlan is weaker now? #Rakshasa 

- Remove dream curse thing?

Ask kala to check our rooms, talk amongst ourselves.

Holmgren cast remove curse, scar fades on me!

Holmgren cast it again on me lol doesn't do anything.


- Maybea lachlan should go in someone dream!

Varenzai really wants to bring up everyone dying in kothemar...

Dont forget Zanzibar is tied to rakshasa

Zanzibar may have taken Jadzia/tora again!

We all talk about how we'll avoid bringing up kothemar. 

Kala checks out our rooms. Found smell? Smell is all of our rooms...

Talking to Kala goes ... well

Kala is concerend for us... 

Zanzibar mentioned...

I my have to use modify memory on Kala... jesus...

Can I even?

Varenzai mentions raksha to Kala

I can cast unles I need material

Group thinks I shouldnt. shes half-elf so I could try, but shed have advantage.

Basically Kala knows everything.

Im unsure thats good, would have wiped her memory. Group seems to want to let her know so I'm going with it. I'm not sure either way anyways.

Launy loves it "woooooow"

Briza falls asleep on my bed. 

Kala knows everything except artifacts... but she totally knows.

She already knew our party the Melvakars...

Briza telling everyhing, completely.

>Meg says as a party we're better at 100m dashes, not 1000m, short bursts. Long form we break apart lol
#party

Jeff thinks Zan needs Holmgren to take the throne?

Lachlan leaves inn as they continue to talk to her. Am I being a bummer?

Kala gives us a sending stone, to call her, tells us not to break the law. 

Wants to meet us by...
