Multi-Classes into Echo Knight! But special [[Meg Knight custimization stuff]].

"When you take a dream from the dreaming world, all the things that could have been die, and only the things it is survive.â€™" Briza

Vola senses a **fiend** 300 feet and undead presences

==We need to short rest yo!==

Varenzai saw a storm last time...

Rakshasa was confirmed w Holmgrens sister right?

Briza thinking of dream she stole from ice queen daughter?? Can we restore it?

Rakshasa - folk tales, lost and being hunted. Well known to completely rely on misdirection and deception. Friends. Can have multiple forms. Even if killed, it would suck for them, but would return to where they came from, reform, easily come back. Must kill them where they originate... from 9 hells.

why didnt it scratch Jadzia? targetted out team. 

Last time zanzibar tried to separate Jadzia from us!! Dead on chair no??

Briza thinks of fly and flies
Makes trees

Lachlan thinks flying and flies...
 Lachlan makes himself beautiful
 
 dream of a tower to protect us. Try taking a long rest.
 Imagine bear protectors. Long rest succeeded.
 
 Briza imagines candle maker
 
 Holmgren standing on a giant bag of holding? 
 
==Lachlan should keep some of his buff from as a reference to his echo knight? Scar on his cheek?==
 
 hear rustling. bag takes us up high. Sound is from every direction? like walking through visions? In a dream maybe? Things feel more real...
 
 hear crying
 
 people talking over each other, solemn. Different languages, reading something. Sorrowful.
 
 tons of people in a graveyard. kneeling on different graves. Blue roses from Kothemar?
 
 Some people look familiar. Large memorial. Funeral for victims of meteors. Mrs. S.
 
 Graves start to shift... the undead vola sensed? Hand comes out of one? frozen soil...
 
 Zombie-esque people rise from graves. Start to attack people. Turn to look at us... Are we spirits? 
 
 Lachlan hears sound of rocking boat. feels empty, no footsteps, laughter, nothing... current drunkards waltz? in mist... bird avoids landing on it??
 
 ==Someone moving. holding lantern... see only silhouette. isnt a lantern, an ethereal moving wisping, dripping, ghost of mrs. willows!! Running hands along the boat. half mornfully and half angrily. looks at me!==
 
 Vola and Holmgren. Lands of kurnfuldor, the capital, bodies everywhere. Dead soldiers, destruction. People fighting. ==See Ivan Grev?== Blackness of his armor, was promoted high rank. Direwolf style pelt? Pompous violence ambience about him. Hacking through people. ==Bren in similar armor, as a soldier==. She's on the verge of collapse. Torso littered with arrows.
 
 Wailing, all these visions overlapping...
 
 More things start to appear that we're floating on. Coins, potions, hempen rope. Large Large Large.
 
 Lachlan runs off towards her. Ship background fades away. Wisdom save.
 
 feet feel heavier, not sure why. Everyone sees ==lachlan age 8 years== infront of everyone.
 
 holmgren tries to stop lachlan, hit him with my cursed dagger...

 Bren is dead... 
 
 Mz Willows, seen ghosts of others, havent returned to grave in long time... is this reality or??
 
 wearing what she was when died. But, ==not wearing necklace!==
 
 trying to hit Holmgren to escape him holding me so I can see Mz Willow ghost...
 
 undead presense now from the dead bren!!
 
 holmgren reaches for slign, lachlan escapes!
 
 we all feel a sensation of time passing...
 
 time slipping us by?
 rock not gathering moss.
 
 holmgren goes attacks undead, we roll initiative for turn orders?
 
 would lachlan know... he aged... that should shock him out of it right? Meg said he felt slowler but didn't see himself age? So I'll ask her to clarify?
 
 Willows moves forward, starts to wail
 
 Everyone ages. Lachlan 1 year more. total of 9 years.
 
 ==lose half of HP Max decreases by half. Permanent? Or curse?==
 
 Where varenzai and brizas nightmares? Is it reality?
 
 Ask meg if I realize mz willow dangerous... hm... because otherwise do I just kill Lachlan dumbly? lol
 
 me very much doing the storyteller player thing lol
 
 --- combat thinking
 
 Misty step? Ask meg if can belated?
 
 oh yeah we can fly!
 
 Banish Miss Willows?!! ohh... like locks upset?
 
 - So misty step reaction...
 - Banish action? Two spells... Reroll doggo maybe?
 - oh shit I have that cube too! vs undead stuff...
 
 - Echo Bonus action
 - Fairy fire always useful.
 
 fuck bren does cry of 71 dmg to Vola...
 
 Briza spots Rakshasa! Sitting. Meditating. Attack them? Where exactly?
 
 Banished Mz Willows ghost! Hurray!
 
 Rak to Briza "do you think its been enough time yet?"
 
 We gon' die?
 
 ==Should I attack another target to remove his curse?! ==
 Yes! Maybe even varenzai lol
 
 Hear Knocking as if at a door?
 
 See Brizas body floating
 
 Varenzai Plummetss down.... Tried rope but didnt work? Maybe we can make him fly?

Wait... dreams... but this is a more real place, not sure how much works!

Hes trying a thing that gives him wings, okay cool

Rakshasa is below where briza was, under the bag of holding?  Again why a bag of holding... balloons?

Bren claws at Vola, have to leave since its 1pm? pausing ending Volas turn?

==change my curse to another, heal holmgren somehow?==

I don't think I'd care about players knowing each others health exactly. It's a marker? #RpgMechanics 

Vola says Rakshsa gone.
