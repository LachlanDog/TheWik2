No Matteo, one of us controlling Varenzai? Ada controlling

Fighting that Orc from... [[Erzof]] [[Jerome]] group #NPC 

Ada decides to do Varenzai British

Golem is crushing it. Like 3 crits.
I do Compulsion spell.
Makes Golem smash more guys.

Holmgren tries to grapple Erzof and toss her into the lava. But its messy mechanics so trying to figure it out.

Noice compulsion + Golem cleaned up like 3 dudes.

==Varenzai (Ada) still hits a team member by accident with lightning arrow lol==

Other competitors probably at [[Fat Dragon Inn]], games gamblings. #PlaceTavern 

Holmgren most popular person out of the fight in the Arena.

Jadzia scryed on Ezrof, she's definitely not here, some place dry and on a horse. Maybe with Jerome?

Other groups saw Ezrof, but not the group she was fighting on.

Jerome couldnt punch butter.

Jerome scry, seemed fine, in a library. Dressed lightly. 

> #question #Erzof
>Erzof somehow struck us all once, each one of the party... important? She had like sharpened claws and fingernails. 

Party at Fat Dragon Inn...

Our wounds from the claw marks, we wake up, slightly hazy. Things seem to melt around us, walls, paintings. Step out of bed, gravity doesn't feel normal, standing on ceiling. Drug trippy. Like something is watching us, following us, weird scratchy noises all around us.

We start to see each other, they appear monstrous version, but that fades. Everything melts till we're just on this flat surface, our footprints leave glow on ground.

We do not see Jadzia. 

Feeling like something we know we hate is around the corner following...

Someone, turns to horror version of theselves... melts away in ashes...

Holmgren casts dispel magic on themself.

Briza remembers something about this... something like this... Not Krampus... a creature, limited magic immunity, spellcasting, violently sharp claws, magically curses. Fill their thoughts ith horrible images, banish them to the plane of dreams.

A Rakshasa. #Creatures 

Odd for Rakshasa to put themselves in positions like this unless it's important or someone asked them.

Not likely to be from Fey Queen...

==Questions: Why would Rakshasa have looked like Half-Orc Lady...==
