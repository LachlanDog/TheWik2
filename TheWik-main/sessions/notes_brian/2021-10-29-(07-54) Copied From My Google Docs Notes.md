After found [[Briza’s old body]] and letter.

  

[[Volgrim’s spellbook]], Briza said she doesn’t need a spellbook… but maybe she’s not a sorcerer?
  

BATTLE! Ice elementals surprise, Hulking thing crawling sounds from the hole

  

Crazy fight, darkness, anti-magic, wild-magic, body switching

  

Jadzia DEAD. Vola DEAD. Meg hitting creatures whilst downed also. TPK? Im going to try the portal to escape who knows.

  

Used portal to mechanus, but party is deafened? Will I retire lachlan? I know meg had so much planned…

  

Monster killed! Hope consequences stick a little though…  
  
Vola, revived by Holmgren, was too late for Jadzia.

[[NPCs/Kala]]. #NPC 

Secret stuffs.

  

Following tracks, find hole and a cavernous hole. Find teeth, gem stone, Find carving of a name - Vormgrim #Vorgrim

  

Remind Briza to read spellbook.

  

Nothing in chasm it seems.

  

Cast banishment on varenzai in ley line… we all go somewhere? Haze of light...Not concentrating.

  

New cave?! Shrill faint cry. Small holes half a foot big. 

No go away! Send Volta in with copper piece, hair attacks her. Stony faced creature, goat legs, hands, like a rock satyr.  Im a koren. Wants earth shiny.

  

Vandalizer. Her… Queen of the winter court? Yeah! Whos in charge if someone sleeping… her ma? Top of the mountain Big black throne. Find us before we find her. Because of Volgrim? 

  

Heart of girl is Locklet #heart

  

Feywild - Time isn’t the same as material plane. Not sure how until you leave? 

  

[[God Veil ]] maybe an entity? Why did they want [[Vorgrim]] taking queens daughter? #GodVeil

  

FEEL CONNECTION TO MY PATRON HERE!!!! SO Cool… wonder if it’s the god veil? Oh man what does it mean… #Lachlan/patron

  

== Feywild, thought to exist as blanket over material plane… not exactly mirror but… potent similarities… mountain ranges… So our cavern here is still the layline… time is tricky, creatures are tricky… love deals and bargains...An echo of the material plane. Magic can be ...moves freely and much more powerful here… when people leave they may lose their memory, lots of magical creatures. Multiple courts… winter summer spring autumn courts… summer and winter main opposing factions, spring autumn… pounce when time is right… very opportunistic courts… not to obliterate but vying for power.==

  

Summer winter most ruthless and most hatred of each other. Other neutral courts apparently, twilight. [[Feywild Courts]]

Feywild… divide between ceily court - summer, unceily court - Winter?

Ceily- good, unceily- evil fey

Unseely, seelie court. #feywild #feywildCourts

Fey known for making deals, chaos, some level of order, kings and queens. Archfey (kings queens) inner circles…

  

Fey, inferior fey don’t exist to them, insignificant.  Each own little patheon, shifts over history who rules. All thought to be from one original pantheon. 
#fey
  
#GodVeil 
==God veil. Giving you what you need or want. God veil is not one location… idea is… if you’re worthy of it’s judgement takes you where you need to be…. Not necessarily one single door… far beyond one single door thing…==
  

Godveil brought briza here because it’s where briza had to be… isn’t just a doorway…

  

Varenzai research into thera… had to get to some fortress… hall that holds the spirits of the damned… in same place? Floating sanctuary and hall are different but same place… #thera

  

  

Thera imprisoned here? Just Varenzai’s hunch.

  

My only fear is Jadzia… #Jadzia

  

Lied about casting banishment, feels bad though… come clean about it once we can’t really turn back or…? Lachlans doing it to explore dunahan though? #Dunahan #Lachlan/patron #Lachlan

  

May 23 2020

  

Heart of the daughter of the queen of the winter court…
#heart
  

Reveal to Varenzai, not banish?

  

Sound Scream. Mountains. Black Figure black spindly hands two horns…. Goatlike

  

What is lachlans plan… meet patron… but scared… hes probably unsure like me but curiosity is getting to him… wouldnt run…

  

Vision goes dark Briza cast cone of cold…

  

Riders trampling of hooves...leaving trail of dead grass…. Decay… Creatures running alongside…

  

Jeff gets megs to alt f4 out of the game

  

Wolf of bones blue glow, scratching howling… wolves with golden melting eyes, like a shadow silent…
#MagicWolves
  

“But you can’t say they weep nonono, that word doesn’t belong here, it belongs… HERE….”

  

Third wolf monstrosity, body covered with oozing weeping eyes… “No air, no drink, no sleep it feeds on souls” Creature lets out dirge… Wolf lets our dirge ou’re forced to stare at it….

  

3rd wolf… no trees around it… in different area than the others… Clawing around in emptiness… mournful song…

Gave us visions? We hear the call but at a distance… call of the 3rd….place of emptiness… sense of hostility… breath sucked out of us…

  

Woman...golden skin… long white blond hair black armor… holds magnificent sword golden red hilt. Gold silver amber ruins...leaves radiant light… She’s maybe in a shadowplane?

  

Man dark brown facial hair, white head hair… several golden bands… armor matches womans sword…

“[[Avandra]], 3 seconds.” #NPC

  

Creature shifts in darkness… woman wings, flys towards creature… man skeletal wings… assamar?

“Fuck this cursed place, this is never going to end”

  

Our vision shifts again like universe expanding out in brilliant colors… shape moving through the sky… out of all the star stuff… dragon! Of stars? Void dragon?

  

Our vision returns to cave… first creature we saw is gone… Was it my patron?? Giving us visions…  
Void dragon… people trapped in the void maybe? Vision from my patron?  #Void #Void/VoidDragon
  
My guess… the queen hunting us… the wolves… not sure, one trapped? We hear the howlin now at a distance...… so did the assimars? Void dragon… attached somehow?

  

[[Avandra]]

[[NPCs/Lyregren]] #NPC

  

IT WAS MELVAKAR!!! MY PATRON!!! #Melvakar #Lachlan/patron 

  

Screech… coming from somewhere in front.

  

Small creature white crystal wings and tails… Little tiny dragon…

  

"Avoid the night. Goblin's have good friends."

Varenzai names dragon baby Aurene

  

Should bring back my amulet. We need to talk about about the vision and Ada will hate it muahah

Do we still here the screams? Aurene a guy?

  

Vola Varenzai hear slight shouting, excited speech? Echoey… 

On side of mountain enormous humanoid skeleton, with sword sticking out of it...Massive

  

4 figures, small, pale green grey skin, Goblins! Laughing, making fun of us.

  

I write in goblin, hi, friend or foe, they laugh, talk in elvish which I dont know but other party ppl do.

  

Should tell Varenzai at end of session haha

  

Goblins “this place sucks, its the worst” oooh sylvan is language of fey creatures!! Use that later… fun.

Doesnt know where nymthalas or god vale is.
#Nymthalas #GodVale
  

Goblins have a settlement at a fortress, pretty cool, they have parties… Urithana is there… Goblin says Fuck they Queen! Queen doesn’t have a face.

  

One seems creepy about wanting us to go to the fortress… just because fey silly?

  

Got to know a lot of languages to speak with a lot of fey creatures.

  

Light seems to be fading, sun going down.

  

Goblins say cant use good or bad for tricky one up there, theres no puppy eating morality scale. Time is weird in the fey. 6 hours of light. 

  

[[Urithana]] is an elf?  Briza disguises self as mini vola or orc child?
#NPC
  

Fortress… very tall… goblins… vines, vibrant leaves, bright red berries...Goodberries…stream of water running through little bridge… crystal clear water...varenzai reaches for water, goblins shout no dont!

Just kidding.

  

Elf, more like a drow, bright red hair, dressed in silks, weird goblins and Elves… no? Thin gaunt happy cocky goblin, dreadlocked hair, holding mug, and arm made of ice.

  

3 silver, goblin gets offended?? Joke or no? Doesn’t seem to be a joke.

  

Seem to understand Sylvan, 

  

Urithana interested in dragon baby varenzai picked up. Varenzais island back on feywild.

  

Will the goblins eat me as a dog?  Does she want to return?

  

Revive Jadzia… but can’t lie for 30 days. Or can’t watch the ritual.

  

Ask Urithana about Melvakar…. When appropriate… We agree to the barter….

  

About 30 hours of night.

  

Questions for Urithana or other goblins, Think of them. 30 hours of night if we stay here.

  

Told party I lied about the banish.

  

## June 6 Urithana attempts to resurrect Jadzia

  

Qs for Urithana… Also 30 hours of night...

Urithana

Goblins didn’t build place, found it. Armory, random weapons. Beds were longer, they hacked them down for some reason. All grimey stuff, doesnt look like Urithana would sleep there. Tents outside goblins talking. Heavier doored room, inside smell of fresh air. Ceiling walls two dsintive types of flowers, purple cabbage sized and hundreds of smaller blue four five long petals little haze of light. 

  

Nicer room is maybe Urithanas? On raised rock

  

Aurocks, like cows around. Four horns. Use as pack animal? Do we need that?

  

Alerag, Bunnies with Horns.

  

Doorway hugely cut, like a van sized.

How long goblins been there?

  

Aurochs and a specific white fluffy cow.


==Willows Journal… Not a language. Code… Symbols or Cypher. Starting to Long patterns… or trying… Recognize some… can’t reconize pattern…== #Lachlan/OwnerJournal

27.June.2021

Jump back into battle we had to pause halfway last session.

  

Need a better way to do notes…. Word is just too linear, everything gets lost? Use word then organize on excel or something? Need a word page by name and what we know?

  

Mindmap for notes stuff? Excel is okay for brainstorming but… for adding info easily mindmap may be better functionality…

  

Anti Magic field - Urithana form changes from drow to Unicorn!!

 In battle everyone getting knocked out. I “heal” Vola.

Those are what Urithana would hand to you before you left; the first is from her. The second...isn't. That's all she would say about it.
#urithana #items 
  

The cube has markings on 2 opposite sides; one has a sigil sequence that you don't know exactly, but the shapes and symbols are familiar to you as sigils used in studies of the arcane. 
#Lachlan/items/cube 
  

The second marked side has a strangeness about it, a heaviness. The markings are unfamiliar, nothing you've ever seen before. They seem to shift slightly as you look at it, and you feel a slight pull towards it before you can blink again and look away. A little 'frodo looking at the ring' sort of heaviness

BIG FIGHT IN ARENA

  

Noice, I rolled a 1 on initiative.

  

Fragment of Elder Starlight

  

This smooth, egg-shaped crystal is about 6 inches tall and sheds an otherworldly bright light out to 20 feet and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light is sunlight. You can touch the crystal and mentally control its brightness as a bonus action to enlarge, reduce, or snuff the light's reach up to its maximum range.

  

While holding the crystal, you can speak its command word as an action to release a wave of bright light from the crystal. The wave of light washes over creatures not behind total cover within a 60-foot radius from the crystal. Undead creatures and fiends affected by the wave of bright light must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d6 radiant damage and is blinded until the end of your next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage and is not blinded. Friendly living creatures of your choice within the wave of bright light regain 4d6 hit points.

  

Once this property of the crystal has been used While its light is dimmed in this way, it sheds bright light out to a maximum of 10 feet and dim light for additional 10 feet.

  

Who’s the favorite? Penelope, Alista.

  

Penelope Never gone down.Elf-ish

Alistar. Tricksy, punches stuff, quicker. Monk? Smart… Can technicaly fly a bit.
