[[Session 2021.11.14 The Dream Realm r]] -> [[Lachlan]] | 2022-01-17
**Lachlan Vision**

From his days on **The Drunkard’s Waltz** -- Gambling/Pleasure boat that he was on

Kind of ship that goes port to port, ready to raise anchor and move on quickly as the winds change

  

Lachlan is going around on the boat

There’s an older man, seems annoyed a dog is there

Another woman is there, talks about how animals have feelings etc.

Man is accused of cheating, and a heated argument ensues

Eventually the man is thrown overboard into shallow water, walks off in the huff

Cheering and revelry ensues

Lachaln walks around with a sense of confidence and belonging like ‘you’re in my house here’

Holmgren does what roles he can, like trying to serve drinks although he’s not well adapted to it

Some of the crew/bouncer-types are his buddies

E.g. one guy no-one has seen before approaches, walks up, Lachlan barks at him, and the bouncers block his pass like ‘dog doesn’t like you, sorry, you can’t come on’

  

JUST BEFORE AWAKENING: Lachlan was just the ship’s dog at this point

-   Seems a bit younger, eyes brighter
    
-   He isn’t exactly like fully aware of anything, but as an animal has intuition about the people
    

  

He remembers this, but now has more insight about it, can make connections -- remembers emotions a lot, remembers the people. He was happy, the days blended together a lot.

  

This was a few years ago, ~4 years ago.

  

Upheaval leaving the boat -- it wasn’t just a big life change, but also he was leaving people he had been seeing every day

-   Maybe never saw them again

[[Session 2021.08.14 The Relaxation Grotto r]] -> [[Lachlan]] | 2022-01-17
Brian remembers he wants to fill Clay in on the deal Lachlan made to save Holmgren

-   They do a quick description and RP of how/when it happened
    
    -   They have some weird conversation where Lachlan tries to explain it in a very roundabout way, Holmgren doesn’t seem incredibly receptive
        
    -   I think it’s something like Holmgren will stop killing everyone when he retires
