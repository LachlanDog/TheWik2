[[Lonny]]'s aunt?

Kala is a general in Elf city [[Nimthalas]] (?) . 

Was in Briza's Ice dragon bones place with us.

Kala survived the item monster, that's how dumb Launy got his bow!

Elusivness of a person in charge. Not like hiding, but someone who is used to dealing with careful information? Not not being helpful, just wants to know what we know or whatever.

```
Says she doesnt know about Vorgrim? Maybe I misunderstood what Meg said? Check Matteos notes

I ask if Ka’la ever comes by -- he looks to his mom and says something in their frog language, -- then he says she comes by sometimes but it wouldn’t really appropriate for her to fight because she’s a general, so mostly like because she’s a professional soldier not really a fair fight.

Good to know thought **Kala Ka’la** is still around, and is a general -- maybe promoted after she recovered those artifacts.
