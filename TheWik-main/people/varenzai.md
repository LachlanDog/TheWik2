[[Session 2021.11.14 The Dream Realm r]] -> [[varenzai]] | 2022-01-17
**Varenzai Vision**

Scene from the Faelar academy ~60 years ago

Elyra, Daesyk, & Varenzai are around a table, working on Kudzu. Varenzai has Kudzu on table, Daesky is reading in a book (of enchantments, magic). Elyra is quietly watching with her ae at her side.

  

Kys & Taern are at another table drinking and arm wrestling, make some comment about hurrying it up to get to the Grotto before dusk, and Varenzai makes a comment back.

Coming out of the shadows, Elyra leans in, squeezes his shoulders, and gives him a kiss on the cheek before disappearing back into the shadows going further into the dark foliage.
