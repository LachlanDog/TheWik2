[[session thingy r]] -> [[Tomb Tapper]] | 2022-01-18
Midway through the start of the fight, we here some weird awful grinding noise rom far off, and something seems to change? Not sure what.

The ground is shaking, almost a pulling sort of noise -- Briza and I see some horrible abomination dragging itself out of the depths, its massive and black and has a lot of teeth -- a fog follows it, it looks like a giant, but all smooth shrouded blackness, its gut is open in a massive maw with tons of teeth. They smell really bad.

  

The thing charges me and fucking eats kudzu!!!! Briza deploys the anti-magic ball, does nothing but block our own spells.

I try diving in after kudzu, am unsuccessful and it just spits me back out, and then the madness commences.

  

Some wild magic effects start going off as we cast the spells.
