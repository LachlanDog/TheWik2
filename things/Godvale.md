[[Session 2021.10.17 The Team Fight]] -> [[Godvale]] | 2022-01-17
## Asking about the Godvale

Getting an audience with the Royal Family would probably be my only hope

They used to be really closed off and shut-in. Wouldn’t see just anyone, and the wait-list is years long.

[[Session 2021.01.17 Briza’s Body r]] -> [[Godvale]] | 2022-01-18
Godvale is a door to where I need to be or give what I need (if worthy) to get Thera back -- it’s not like a prison where she’s trapped or something that took her soul, it’s essentially a door or connection to the Feywild in a sense, but in a wishing well give you what you need put you where you need to be for a price.

[[Session 2020.08.16 The Closed Day r]] -> [[Godvale]] | 2022-01-18
Thrall tells us this about the [[godvale]]:

Thrall is not from this plane, they come from Dream plane

Tree is god, will judge, if good you’ll go where you’re going (some sort of portal connected to dream plane?)

Ulutiu, god of the Godvale tree, God of the Ice and the arctic. Rangers and people who follow the nature of the Arctic worship him

[Session 2020.08.09 The End of Secrets r](../sessions/notes_matteo_brianedit/Session%202020.08.09%20The%20End%20of%20Secrets%20r.md) -> [Godvale](TheWik-main/things/Godvale.md) | 2022-01-19
[GODVALE DESCRIPTION]

Towards the end of the ritual when Varenzai feels it should be over, he has a vision. He is standing before a great White Tree, glittering like Moonstones. He has flowers and leaves plants sprouting along his arms. Looking down water begins to rise around his feet with an icy bitter biting cold. He moves towards the tree as the cold seeps up his limbs, and it brings him warmth and comfort.

Arriving at the tree out of the cold he is hit by an intense wave of familiarity within the tree stronger than anything he’s ever felt. He realises the tree is not white, but actually crystalline and made of crystal. Reaching the tree he feels his bond to Thera, like a vine entwining them together stronger than it ever has been, and understands it is his past and future. As he awakens, Thera does not return -- he realises she is not gone but trapped somewhere.

Varenzai gets the sense this tree is somewhere in the arctic, sees that terrain and mountains around it. Doesn’t know exactly what it means, but wants to ask someone who knows magical history -- ALOY. Gets the sense that Thera feels lost, is also trying to get back but can’t find the way.
