[[Session 2021.10.17 The Team Fight]] -> [[Godvale]] | 2022-01-17
## Asking about the Godvale

Getting an audience with the Royal Family would probably be my only hope

They used to be really closed off and shut-in. Wouldn’t see just anyone, and the wait-list is years long.

Godvale is a door to where I need to be or give what I need (if worthy) to get Thera back -- it’s not like a prison where she’s trapped or something that took her soul, it’s essentially a door or connection to the Feywild in a sense, but in a wishing well give you what you need put you where you need to be for a price.

[[Session 2020.08.16 The Closed Day r]] -> [[Godvale]] | 2022-01-18
Thrall tells us this about the [[godvale]]:

Thrall is not from this plane, they come from Dream plane

Tree is god, will judge, if good you’ll go where you’re going (some sort of portal connected to dream plane?)

Ulutiu, god of the Godvale tree, God of the Ice and the arctic. Rangers and people who follow the nature of the Arctic worship him
