For a vampire drinking someone is an endless battle, is like the adventure of trying to win a game to know yourself better or kill yourself in the process. You never know if someone or something will escape or bring you the greatest pleasure you have ever experienced.
 If somewhere people were rounded up, a small morsel of delight, woman or man, filling you with ecstasy and vigor, a light snack with wild unruly hair or fleet of foot came at you in the night, searching desperately, hopelessly, mindlessly around for a way to escape. 
You should recognize well when a rabbit is followed by predator, the scream revealing it knows its end is near. A time for the triumphant hunter and a time for feast. Do you hear it singing? Not anymore my dearest, I trust she has indeed forgotten her own voice in death. Run little rabbit. Run. Run. Run.
