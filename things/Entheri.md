[[Session 2021.08.01 The Well of the Candlemaker]] -> [[Entheri]] | 2022-01-18
Varenzai writes a note on some parchment in sylvan:

“Varenzai, a free Entheri, travelled through here on [Today's Date]. Other free [[Entheri]] should please seek out and contact me.”

He leaves this in the cave sealed in a glass bottle.

[[Session 2021.07.11 The Funeral of Holmgren Grenwold r]] -> [[Entheri]] | 2022-01-18
I ask about reuniting, in particular note I don’t know much about travelling between planes -- she says neither do they, and my best hope at ‘reuniting, whatever that may mean to you’ would be to ‘change their minds’

No real technical advice on how to actually contact them, but that felt reassuring.

[[Session 2021.06.06 The Resurrection of Jadzia Bronzerock r]] -> [[Entheri]] | 2022-01-18
7-8 years ago a bunch of [[Entheri]] came through to a cavern that was once a forest ~10km from here, not really sure why, I don’t have a specific memory
    
-   Otherwise no one of my people has really been through, but various members of other races have for different reasons, looking for shelter or fey treasures or travelling between cities, or lost

Threshold Crest -- Magical stones that anchor something, like a city/region/place and allow it to transport to another plane of existence in a time of crisis

This is what the [[Entheri]] used to shift [[Elysia]] to another

NOT BOUND TO ANYTHING NOT SURE WHERE

Essentially: the entheri didn’t want to be bound to the material anymore, but in doing so fucked up, helped create ‘leyline crsis’ where the planes are beginning to bleed over into one another, and they are no longer bound to any one place, not sure where they are now

I think there was something about Entheri destabilizing themselves so their Island continent isn’t tethered to any one plane anymore, but is kinda suspended or travelling between them all

I share with party a bit more about my backstory, fighting in resistance and stuff, leaving for own safety

[[Session 2021.05.23 Exploring the Feywild r]] -> [[Entheri]] | 2022-01-18
-   Walking with them I ask if they’ve ever met any of my kind -- one says he’s seen like 40’000 and met 5’000, I assume he’s just joking around
        
        -   Later it will be revealed he was probably not just joking around
