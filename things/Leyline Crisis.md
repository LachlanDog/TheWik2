[[Session 2021.06.06 The Resurrection of Jadzia Bronzerock r]] -> [[TheWik-main/things/Leyline Crisis]] | 2022-01-18
Essentially: the entheri didn’t want to be bound to the material anymore, but in doing so fucked up, helped create ‘[[TheWik-main/things/Leyline Crisis]]’ where the planes are beginning to bleed over into one another, and they are no longer bound to any one place, not sure where they are now

RE Leyline Crisis, people misunderstand, foolish to think you could tame a place in the Feywild for your own.

Theory: It’s my people’s fault Thera didn’t come back this time, when she died her spirit went back to Elysia through the Leylines because it’s in the Feywild now.

-   **[[TheWik-main/Leyline Crisis]]:** Entheri have manipulated magic and returned their whole continent to the Fey realm, magically planeshifted the land it seems like
    
-   **Phasing Out:** Somehow magically kill people? Send them to the next phase? Could involve meditation?
