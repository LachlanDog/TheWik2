[[Session 2021.01.17 Briza’s Body r]] -> [[puzzle_box]] | 2022-01-18
Holmgren plays around with a [[puzzle_box]] he found, Kala does as well, then gives it to Jadzia who doesn’t know wtf to do with it. She hands it to Briza and it immediately opens.

It contains:

A fancy dagger

A sickle!!!

An orange-sized heart thing

5 ornate gems (not diamonds, but very fancy gems)

A tiny sword that grows into a greatsword as it comes out, it’s VERY black
