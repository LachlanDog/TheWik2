Puts Briza in a dream back to the meteors, where she found Ms. S’s body. Beside the body is an open box of chocolate. As Briza finds the body, Lachlan runs up and cries ‘What did you do Briza? What did you do?!’

Briza fails her save for this and is scarred

Vola: Anytime she does damage, it will be reflected back to a random party member
