[[Session 2021.05.09 Holmgren in the pit r]] -> [[Vorgrim]] | 2022-01-18
They find the name ‘Vorgrim’ carved into the small cavern there, and then carve their own names, then head back out.

[[Session 2021.01.17 Briza’s Body r]] -> [[Vorgrim]] | 2022-01-18
Vola med checks the body we found. She finds a ceremonial looking dagger on it, and the throat is slit, looks self-inflicted

The body seems to be 120~130 years old

This gnome was about ~450 years old when died, skin has turned grey but seemed to originally be the same colour as Briza’s, a bit shorter than Briza but probably because of age. Faded ring line

We find books on her desk opened to a page, its written in celestial then common then gnomish. Titled Vorgrims Frozen Tempest, crossed out and retitled Vorgrims Grimoire of Echoes. There was also a Journal.

[[Session 2021.01.17 Briza’s Body r]] -> [[Vorgrim]] | 2022-01-18
Kala recognizes the body but is toying with us, not for any evil or bad reason but just because its more of a game to her. She found a glass crystal-ball thing, probably her orb.

[[Session 2021.01.17 Briza’s Body r]] -> [[Vorgrim]] | 2022-01-18
The ring has the name inscribed inside of it: Briza Vorgrim

[[Session 2021.01.17 Briza’s Body r]] -> [[Vorgrim]] | 2022-01-18
Lachlan investigates the tank, Kala found the orb beside it. It has a sort of salty liquid inside, we determine it’s the right size and properties that it could have potentially been used to grow a body!

[[Session 2021.01.17 Briza’s Body r]] -> [[Vorgrim]] | 2022-01-18
The Journal:

Mostly celestial at beginning, then common, last part in gnomish

Earliest writings were from ~240 second era (Currently 869). Writings are interspersed with runic, over time there’s a notable shift of the handwriting going from beautiful cursive to printing to chicken scratch, and less detailed. Written in many different colours and inks
