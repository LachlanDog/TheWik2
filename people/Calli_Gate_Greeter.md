-   Lachlan is unsuccessful but Varenzai manages to spot her:
    
    -   Short gnomish woman, wearing nice bright yellow doublet, holding sack of papers and fliers and quills, taking notes
        
-   She’s very nice and very helpful, remembers helping a fancy dragonborn
    
-   Told him to go to brightcastle
    
-   GILDED PILLOW
    
-   We thank her profusely and each tip her a platinum piece, she gives us a 5% off coupon and invites us to tea

I get back to our Inn, Tora hasn’t been back, I ask if Sphynx owner knows of a Birght Blue Dragonborn, where he might be saying, he gives me a contact “Calli” who stays near the gate and helps visitors and tourists, she might know, so I go to see him.
