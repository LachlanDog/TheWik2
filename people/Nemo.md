Nemo gets wasted and laments that her imaginary friend in grade 2 wouldn’t be her friend

Nemo’s dad is ‘god of the forest’ -- urk takes her to bed. “The forest moves cause it has legs and it walks around, you’ll never find it!”

Nemo links arms with Varenzai and walks with him, explains they’re with the airship, trying to get out of city to let Lulu fly around because she’s restless (they don’t want to let a giant predatory hawk fly freely within the city, but guards won’t let them out)
