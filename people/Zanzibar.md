[[Session 2020.10.05 Holmgren’s Sister r]] -> [[Zanzibar]] | 2022-01-18
[[Zanzibar]] = HOLMGREN’S SISTER -- EDIT LATER 07.06.2020 : SHE’s PROBABLY EVIL

-   Also Asimar
    
-   About same age, slightly younger, but looks much younger and very youthful -- was lost in Astral plane where she didn’t age
    
-   Has been looking for Holmgren her whole life with her parents
    
-   Came to take Holmgren to claim his ‘birthright’ -- that quest and other stuff isn’t as important -- this is annoying Tora

Thrall translates the Ghyf letter for us. It says:

“Grenwold. You’ve said, time and time again, you knew who had this exalted staff, and where they’ve gone. Her patience grows very thin. You wander through these planes like a wildling. Your gift was not given without strings, and they grow taut in her grasp. She... is timeless. You...are timeless. For now. The shadow will follow the boy. Bring him to the divide, or we will. And not without leaving your fate to the voidstones, which will be your only companions. Dictated but not read, Vlaakith CLVII”
