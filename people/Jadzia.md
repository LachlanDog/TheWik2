[[Session 2021.08.14 The Relaxation Grotto r]] -> [[Jadzia]] | 2022-01-17
Varenzai tries to talk to Jadzia with everyone about how she reacted in the Faewild, she pretty much just dodges it, says she doesn’t want to talk about personal things and the ‘main show’ main concern was the stuff with Briza-clone and the Winter Queen coming after us.

She is starting to recover physically, but Varenzai gets a sense she’s really struggling internally with the 3-year thing, it’s very hard for her.
