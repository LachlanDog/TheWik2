[[Session 2021.07.11 The Funeral of Holmgren Grenwold r]] -> [[Elyra]] | 2022-01-18
Varenzai finds a quiet area, sniffs one and whispers in the name “[[Elyra]]”.

Sweet sweet candy-type spell -- reminds of Briza, try to hear my thoughts with the visions of my friend

Everything feels very disjointed, can’t really focus on them -- hear voices, but they sound disjointed

Visions of thousands and thousands of people, not necessarily people I know, not Entheri, but I hear all kinds of voices from everywhere, gets very very disjointed and painful, piercing, builds, and I take a large amount of Psychic Damage and feel pained.

The petal I plucked to activate the effect fades, and the flower explodes -- assume spell failed, she’s not on this plane.
