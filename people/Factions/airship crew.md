They say they also want to leave, but are going to wait 2-3 days -- they told the city they’re going to stop trading with them, so don’t want to piss them off further by sneaking out

## The Airship:

The Stormlight

Dragon Class Aravel Ship

Lots of filigree, ornate metal, dragon imagery as well as other mythology

Lightly to medium armoured -- much more obviously for speed than war

A few heavy cannons on board
