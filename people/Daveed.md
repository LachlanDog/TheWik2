[[Session 2020.10.05 Holmgren’s Sister r]] -> [[Daveed]] | 2022-01-18
When we went to see Daveed some half-orc left in a huff

Ly’Ara is Daveed’s wife!!!!!

He wants us to sign some book to join his worldwide secret organisation in return for protection from the veil

-   Daveed insinuates Varenzai’s theory about the assasination was right -- that the Veil are going after us, but he can protect us from them if we sign his book. Because Briza didn’t sign, she’s not protected.

-   Daveed insinuates Tora is very shady, has asked Holmgren why we’re with her anyways and when Holmgren said he loves her ‘There’s plenty of other people out there.’
    
-   Daveed: “No one ever says they’re working with Tora, or plenty do but they’re never right. She only has people working for her.”
    
-   He stresses again as Holmgren asks that he has no idea where Tora was

Holmgren explains the connection to Daveed about being handed the letter and told to deliver it -- he doesn’t remember where so Varenzai doesn’t know it was given to flower girl necesarrily, but does know now that Daveed is connected.

**Daveed Visit:**

Lachlan enters, Daveed is upset, comforting his daugher -- shop is closed but we go in

When we come in, sends his daughter home

I ask if this means we’re done our contract “You’re never done.” Along the lines of ‘don’t you understand what you did signing that book, you’re in now’.

Stresses “Didn’t you understand what I meant when I said we were equals, why would I understand anything more than you do”

Doesn’t answer when I ask where Ly’Ara is. Says he doesn’t know where Tora is or that Bolero was in the city (Bolero = Biaro)

Basically just gets mad at us, is clearly upset at being used as a pawn and doesn’t want to talk about it, shoos us out.

Lachlan tries taking some healing potions and supplies as we walk out -- gets cursed

As I go out I say “I thought you’d know more about your family affairs is all” He takes great offense to this, tries to curse me but we get out.
