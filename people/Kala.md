# Notes references

[[Lonny]]'s aunt?

Kala is a general in Elf city [Nymthalas](../places/Nymthalas.md) (?) . 

Was in Briza's Ice dragon bones place with us.

Kala survived the item monster, that's how dumb Launy got his bow!

Elusivness of a person in charge. Not like hiding, but someone who is used to dealing with careful information? Not not being helpful, just wants to know what we know or whatever.

```
Says she doesnt know about Vorgrim? Maybe I misunderstood what Meg said? Check Matteos notes
```

[[Session 2021.08.22 Dining & Dashing r]] -> [[Kala]] | 2022-01-17
I ask if Ka’la ever comes by -- he looks to his mom and says something in their frog language, -- then he says she comes by sometimes but it wouldn’t really appropriate for her to fight because she’s a general, so mostly like because she’s a professional soldier not really a fair fight.

Good to know thought **Kala Ka’la** is still around, and is a general -- maybe promoted after she recovered those artifacts.

---

[[Session 2021.05.09 Holmgren in the pit r]] -> [[Kala]] | 2022-01-18
We pick up Ka’la’s trail at the bottom of the cavern -- her tracks lead way down deeper in, and then back up the other side of the cliff.

---

[[Session 2021.04.11 r]] -> [[Kala]] | 2022-01-18
The creature is dead before, looks cutting open, any semblance of a digestive system is missing, seems like Ka’la took it.

  

The other’s are like ‘That bitch! Took our stuff’ but I said that’s basically what we would have done in her case, like party of adventurers goes missing, maybe dead, and leaves behind a bunch of magical items

---

[[Session 2021.01.17 Where’s Krampus r]] -> [[Kala]] | 2022-01-18
For the most part, the other watches pass mostly uneventfully -- until on Briza’s, she sees some elf-like creature near the edge of camp, about 80’ away, blue sallow skin, white pupiless eyes. She yells for its attention then waves at it, it waves back, but doesn’t speak.

  

The elf asks what we’re doing and how many friends she has. Briza says we’re looking for Thera and as many as she can get. The elf says their name is **Kala** and they are looking. The elf knows of Vakkmigr but not personally

  

**Kala** wants Briza to show them around inside the fortress, says they’ll take us to the godvale if she does. Kala says they are from a big city.

---

[[Session 2021.01.17 Where’s Krampus r]] -> [[Kala]] | 2022-01-18
**Kala** wears very fancy armour, some sort of Elven Mithril. Able to cast spells.

  

We ask Kala about the Godvale and stuff, she tells us she can take us there, most people know where it is, the trouble is accessing it:

Godvale is a test, trouble isn’t getting there, it’s getting an audience, they can’t guarantee we’ll survive the audience but can probably get us one. Test to give you what you want. “Was she of this plane originally?”

Kala is from Nythm’Thalas

Personal interest in the fortress

---

[[Session 2021.01.17 Where’s Krampus r]] -> [[Kala]] | 2022-01-18
Kala is most interested in the areas where Briza couldn’t go

---

[[Session 2021.01.17 Where’s Krampus r]] -> [[Kala]] | 2022-01-18
### From Insight Check:

-   She’s clearly looking for something specific and powerful/magical in the fortress.
    
    -   Most interested in the closed door Briza is describing that she couldn’t get through
        
    -   She’s giving a polite interest to the other thing Briza is saying, but is most interested in that.
        
-   Probably heard from scouting reports or something what had happened at the fortress, and that it was more easily accessible now.
    
    -   Some militaristic/driven character about them.
        
-   Godvale is in Nythm’Thalas, the audience we seek has to be with the king there.
    
    -   ==Some hint of sadness when they spoke of it, as if they sought something from it and were unsuccessful in trying to gain it.==
        
-   They genuinely did recognize Briza, they’re somewhat older for an elf and the way they said I know you was more with a sense of nostalgia, like remembering someone they knew from a long time ago

[[Session 2021.01.17 Where’s Krampus r]] -> [[Kala]] | 2022-01-18
### From Persuasion Check (What are you looking for)

-   They promise they will take it, not a threat, but even if we try keeping it from them or whatever, they will leave with them
    
-   Looking for a magic orb and a magic sickle

---

[[Session 2021.01.17 Where’s Krampus r]] -> [[Kala]] | 2022-01-18
ASK KALA HOW SHE KNOWS BRIZA AND WHAT THIS IS AND DO SOME CHECK ON THE BODY

---

[[Session 2021.01.17 Briza’s Body r]] -> [[Kala]] | 2022-01-18
Lachlan has a bit of a back and forth with Kala about what she’s up to

She says:

The orb belongs to Nythm’Thalas, as do I, I am returning it. Many thought it was here but it was difficult to get to.

She denies that it relates to her trials in the Godvale, says she has no desire to be tested there.

---

[[Session 2021.01.17 Briza’s Body r]] -> [[Kala]] | 2022-01-18
Kala knows a lot and was generally helpful in the end, if withholding.
