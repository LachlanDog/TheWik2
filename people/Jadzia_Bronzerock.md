[[Session 2021.08.14 The Relaxation Grotto r]] -> [[Jadzia_Bronzerock]] | 2022-01-17
Varenzai tries to talk to Jadzia with everyone about how she reacted in the Faewild, she pretty much just dodges it, says she doesn’t want to talk about personal things and the ‘main show’ main concern was the stuff with Briza-clone and the Winter Queen coming after us.

She is starting to recover physically, but Varenzai gets a sense she’s really struggling internally with the 3-year thing, it’s very hard for her.

[[Session 2021.04.11 r]] -> [[Jadzia_Bronzerock]] | 2022-01-18
We decide to wrap Jadzia’s body up in the bedroll tied with silken rope, as this is happening a disposal modron runs straight for the body. Lachlan is able to dismiss it.

[[Session 2020.11.08 Hints of Brian r]] -> [[Gunnar]] | 2022-01-18
Holmgren dun goofed -- in the vision we learned [[Jadzia_Bronzerock]] had been engaged to by [Gunnar](Gunnar.md), **a noble from the East**, but turned him down publicly -- the diamond she had given Holmgren was from this ring, that he had chopped up and not told her. They’re not talking about this.

[Session 2020.08.09 The End of Secrets r](../sessions/notes_matteo_brianedit/Session%202020.08.09%20The%20End%20of%20Secrets%20r.md) -> [Jadzia_Bronzerock](Jadzia_Bronzerock.md) | 2022-01-19
We learn Jadzia is from Kourn’fel’Dour -- Capital of the Western Kingdom that’s going to war, Jadzia is princess here -- Bronzerock.

[Session 2020.07.02 Stabby stab room r](../sessions/notes_matteo_brianedit/Session%202020.07.02%20Stabby%20stab%20room%20r.md) -> [Jadzia_Bronzerock](Jadzia_Bronzerock.md) | 2022-01-19
Jadzia, who was Tora all along (cast illusion and lied about name, Holmgren knew the whole time) starts to wake up, her and Holmgren share a touching romantic moment, Varenzai begins to mourn the loss of Thera, warns party to say Zanzibar summoned the dragon and we Banished it.
