[[Session 2021.08.22 Dining & Dashing r]] -> [[Elemmakil]] | 2022-01-17
[[Elemmakil]].

  

She recommends we stay at **The Beautiful Fox,** north of Rimecrest.

She’s not being snarky or anything, but is amused like we’re a caricature of foreigner’s visiting.

She gets us a map, the guards are very formal and disciplined, but can see they resent little duties like getting a map
