## The final Airship Days

We are 3-4 days from landfall, describing how we spend that time

  

**Lachlan** talks to **Gryffon** more and tries deciphering the book he was given. It’s written in a cipher by **Mrs. Willows.**

**Holmgren** stares at the conch. Tries to get permission to stay and study it in the Air Elementals room, Lorca tells him to put a deposit of 40 gold down to do so, Holmgren tells her to fuck off

**Varenzai** talks to **Thrall** a bit, gets a delicious plant dish. She says she doesn’t know her people (either orphaned or they were all destroyed) has been on the airship a long time, but not as long as **Gryffon**. Talks to **Aerindor**:

-   **Leyline Crisis:** Entheri have manipulated magic and returned their whole continent to the Fey realm, magically planeshifted the land it seems like
    
-   **Phasing Out:** Somehow magically kill people? Send them to the next phase? Could involve meditation?
    
-   **Crew plans:** no solid plans after they drop us off, they’re not going to hang around but might pick us up again.
    
-   **Harrowfrost Plains**: She’s never heard of this specifically
    

**Vola** hangs out with Nemo, tries talking to Cat and Peaches, Cat is cool, Peaches won’t talk to her

**Vola** is from **Bhalgozul**

**Briza** causes general mischief and mayhem, carves her name, finds dark iron arrows.

**Varenzai** talks to **Jadzia:**

-   Things seem ok with her an Holmgren, they obviously had some tension but are just reassuring each other
    
    -   She says she questions his judgment, but also her own
        
-   She thinks we’ll find the **coronet** in Nythm’Thalas
    
-   Varenzai says again his focus when landing will be Thera, and he has some leads
    

**Aerindor** looks at the maps we had found on **Zanzibar**: **Zanzibar Maps**

-   Map of the Astral plane, very clear and detailed
    
-   Map of the Negative Plane
    
-   Map of the Southern Shiverreach, southern part of arctic we first arrived
    
-   Map of the Ethereal Plane
    
-   Map she has no idea what it is
    

Deal with **Aerindor** for **Walkie-Talkie** Earrings

-   Go to Sime Tolic (East Capital) or Kurnfaldur (West Capital)
    
-   She gave us something to deliver to either a goblin named Gring Jo or a dragonborn named Kaleb
    

  

  

# Off the Airship

We arrive over the ‘drop-off’ point, Gryffon has us just jump off the ship, everyone gets down in their own way (I think he cast Feather Fall on Vola, I ride down on Jadzia as an eagle)

We have a bit of discussion over which way to go, Briza is a big asset because of her familiarity with the arctic. I hear a Yeti howl.

Holmgren tries and fails to make snowshoes

We decide to head generally in the direction of the Bodr Mountains, I think that way is our best chance of finding Thera

  

We find a good little cave to stop for the night, I radio **Aerindor** and we talk about our plans:

**Aerindor** says that there’s almost certainly people in Nythm’Thalas we could ask who know these things, almost all knowledge of anything especially this magic stuff is available there

**Aerindor** says we wouldn’t be arrested or anything when we arrived at **Nythm’Thalas**, but it wouldn’t be like a warm reception or anything. She says we’ll be fine so long as we “Don’t insult the big guy, don’t insult his wife”.

  

As we walk we see a giant dark chasm a long way (few days walk), called the Spine of the Mountain, big notable landmark

  

We rest in our cave and take watches. On her’s Briza sees and follows some floating motes of light. She finds floating buildings in a cavern!!!! We meet up there, and some floating mystery magic lady invites her up. She tells Briza this is not the Godvale.

ASK FLOATING LADY ABOUT THERA AND GODVALE
