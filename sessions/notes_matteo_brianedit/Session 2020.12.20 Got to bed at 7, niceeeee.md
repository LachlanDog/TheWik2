During the Recap Holmgren reveals he did more Wizard Drugs during out march and f’ed himself over again

## The Outskirts of Kamp Krampus

Description: Theme of punishment, sack, cloven hooves, chains, fur, Frost Giant on all fours being whipped, lead by chains

The closer we get to this camp and further from our own, there is this deep creeping chill that penetrates us, disproportionate, almost a magic barrier

We get within 120’, hear the chain first, dragging across rock and snow

Creature: Very large, smaller than a frost giant, but at least 10’ tall.

Fog impedes our vision as we approach, we get incredibly cold

As I look at it and try to sus it out, I start to feel sleepy, in a way I never have since I meditate.

  

I try to figure out if my holy arrows would affect it more, roll a nat 1, and it radiates light out giving away our position.

  

Creepy white eyed face with teeth with an uncanny smile looks like he’s staring right at us

I use Fade Away to go invisible and BOOK IT with Jadzia bird

  

Vola radios in to ask what’s up, I say we’re coming back, but roll Survival to take a convoluted path back to try and mislead anything following us

## Back at Home Camp

We get back to camp, Jadzia transforms back, and we discuss everything we saw -- Jadzia doesn’t immediately rat me out which is nice.

We figure out the Jerky Vola found was ‘Orc Rinds’, made of orc.

Briza eats ANOTHER chocolate

I have a bit of a sidebar about strategy with Holmgren

Lachlan is convinced we need Mistletoe to attack it.

  

I bring up the possibility of trying to reason for it but that seems unlikely and I suggest we all sneak attack at the same time instead.

  

**Jarl:** Bigger than most Frost Giants, lots of scars that he proudly wears as Badges of Honour -- we think that was the one held by Krampus

  

**Briza** says **Vakkmigr** won’t come and help us with this for some reason

  

I generally turn people to my side that we should just attack it head-on -- the party wants to just try using the conch, I would like to avoid that at all costs except as a last resort.

  

We spend the whole rest of the day discussing, I don’t notice anything coming up to or threatening camp, but I do notice a lack of any wildlife, it’s eerily quiet.

  

Spend rest of day discussing, I read my Void Dragon book.

  

## The resting at night

We take watches, not much activity except Jadzia says she feels cold at points, is nervous.

As I come out of my trance and keep reading, Lachlan takes his watch, sneaks over to Briza and casts Dream:

  

Puts Briza in a dream back to the meteors, where she found Ms. S’s body. Beside the body is an open box of chocolate. As Briza finds the body, Lachlan runs up and cries ‘What did you do Briza? What did you do?!’

Briza fails her save for this and is scarred

  

Eventually night ends, some people felt flashes of the cold, but we all wake up ok

  

## The March to Kamp Krampus

At first light we begin to make our way towards Krampus. We discuss strategy on the way and settle that I’ll bring them close then scout ahead.

  

I go ahead, stealth ok but don’t see much, so I try to get closer and closer. Eventually I accidentally come right up on him, and get charmed -- in this case my Sylvan heritage is a big disadvantage, I seem especially susceptible to him.

  

Unable to contact me with the earpieces, the party moves forward (very clumsily except for Vola). They come up to the cave without finding anything, I was stealthy enough to leave no trail.

  

Eventually they come up into the cave where Krampus makes me wait to ambush them, I shoot an arrow that would’ve hit but Briza has something to block it. Krampus appears behind them, casts PAIN on Holmgren and Home for the Holidays (Banishment) on Vola, but she just makes her save (AT DC 23!!!!)

  

Lots of Combat, Krampus summons demons, I do mad damage, Holmgren misses a ton of rolls, Jadzia and Lachlan do cool shit, I turn Vola into a Dragon again!! He banishes Dragon Vola and knocks out Jadzia
