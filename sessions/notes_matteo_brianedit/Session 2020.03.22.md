Still in Ko’Themar

Lachlan spoke to someone named Holderheck -- leader of a religious order, needs some jobs done

-   In particular, wants a Young White Dragon to stop from attacking neighbouring towns
    
-   Young White Dragon: Second smallest, uses cold/arctic attacks
    
    -   One of them most vicious of the chromatic dragons, makes up for the fact that they’re more simplistic -- not very vengeful or play with food, just hunts and kills
        

Market District:

-   Octavius Oddities -- guy Aloy told us to look up but not mention her to
    
    -   David -- shopowner? Eccentric hot half orc
        
    -   Carmella -- Half-elf girl who works for him, city doesn’t like her
        
    -   Made some secret deal with him to kill a monster in the sewers -- 3000 gold + lepurine helmet for Vola -- must keep it top secret and tell no one
        
        -   Could be to set up thieve’s guild or set up secret pass to Nym Thalas through sewers?
            

Arboreals: Plant race throughout the arctic, masters of stealth, wilds. Mostly hunters, keep to themselves

Other stuff but I was sick
