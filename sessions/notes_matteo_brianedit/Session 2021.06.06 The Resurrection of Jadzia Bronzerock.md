Urithana is in the thick of her ritual, so we go around talking about what we want to do while she’s busy conducting it.

Clay forgot we had a session and showed up 10 mins late LOL NOW THIS IS RECORDED FOREVER

  

### Briza

Explores around casually and talks to the goblins

They tell her they didn’t build this place, they found it.

Forest was maybe closer at one point but they’ve been pushing it further back

The beds are all sawed in half cause Goblins short.

No clear room/area where Urithana might sleep.

One room with a heavier door and circular brass handle -- inside, incredible smell of fresh air, like opening a window.

Inside is a blue flower with many layers of petals like a lotus or artichoke -- peppermint/sandalwood smelling

-   OH SHIT THEY MIGHT BE GOODBERRY FLOWERS
    

A stable with 7-8 Auroks -- large, yak-like creature

  

He finds a pen with 7-8 Almiraj -- bunnies with horns

### Lachlan

Reads & tries to decipher Mrs. Willows journal

Basically establishes it’s some kind code not meant to be broken, so will need to find some way around that.

### Holmgren

Sleeps outside of the ritual door

### Varenzai, Vola, Lachlan

Talk to goblins to try to learn things

-   Avandra: Name of a goddess, so some of us and some of them are familiar
    
    -   Daughter of Seyaline and Koralon in the Elven Pantheon
        
    -   Symbolises change
        
-   They talk about people come through, not really a straight answer of whether they’re from the Feywild or not more like ‘dude we’re just here don’t worry about it, sometimes you end up places’
    
-   BUFFLEWUMP -- some kind of ~secret weapon~
    
-   7-8 years ago a bunch of Entheri came through to a cavern that was once a forest ~10km from here, not really sure why, I don’t have a specific memory
    
-   Otherwise no one of my people has really been through, but various members of other races have for different reasons, looking for shelter or fey treasures or travelling between cities, or lost
    
-   There are various settlements and small cities and villages throughout the feywild
    
-   Queen of the Winter Court is typically invisible, need magic to see her
    
-   She has a large court of all kinds of minions she can whistle to to issue commands
    
-   The wolves we saw in vision are bad news, bone one you die if you see
    

Vola talks to the Almiraj, they’re here because it’s warm and happy

## HOW TO CARE FOR YOUR DRAGON

Get from Meg basic things for caring for Aurene, like sleep and food and stuff

-   Dragons in general, especially one this young, needs more sleep than typical 8-hour
    
-   Ice dragon would eat mostly meat, especially a young growing girl
    

  

  

DOOM BLOOM

A ‘headache’ if what or who you try to look for is more savvy than you

Smell the flower, say a name, if they’re on the same plane it works like the scrying

  

  

Threshold Crest -- Magical stones that anchor something, like a city/region/place and allow it to transport to another plane of existence in a time of crisis

This is what the Entheri used to shift Elysia to another

NOT BOUND TO ANYTHING NOT SURE WHERE

Essentially: the entheri didn’t want to be bound to the material anymore, but in doing so fucked up, helped create ‘leyline crsis’ where the planes are beginning to bleed over into one another, and they are no longer bound to any one place, not sure where they are now

  

  

DENDAR: night serpent, created the first time a mortal creature had a dream, based on what they dreamt?

-   She consumes nightmares
    
-   People that serve her create nightmares for her to eat
    
-   She’s who Ruru was serving in that Myconid cave, opening a portal for
    

Thought to live in the Fugue plane

  

The weeping wolf -- does not exist here, only exists in one place

No one knows how they come into being

They feed on souls, getting larger and bigger as they eat

When they eat you your soul is captured and you grow as an eye on its body for as long as it’s alive

Creatures on the body have their soul trapped, you cannot revivify etc.

“I haven’t seen it with my own eyes, I saw it in a vision, as I saw most things”

Only exist in the negative plane

## ENTHERI STUFF

--feels like there was probably a lot more I should’ve taken notes on

I think there was something about Entheri destabilizing themselves so their Island continent isn’t tethered to any one plane anymore, but is kinda suspended or travelling between them all

I share with party a bit more about my backstory, fighting in resistance and stuff, leaving for own safety

  

Then some evil nasty creature attacked, Urithana seemed real chill, a bunch of goblins died

Important instruction we got was not to let Jadzia be disturbed so I figured we should go run to protect the door to her room but no one else really seemed to think that was important, fuck her I guess

Fight ensues, bunch of goblins die but Vola Smash and we summon all kinds of friends to help

  

BUFFLEWUMP -- Friend, Alpine Minotaur

Mammoth, friend

Wolves, friends

Goblins, friends

Enemies:

Sniffura, polar mounts

Shadow bitch

Giant chilly Ice Dude
