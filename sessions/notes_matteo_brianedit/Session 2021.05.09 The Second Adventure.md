Varenzai & Thera: Takes place before the last one, before Varenzai sold his soul at the church

  

Varenzai and Thera are in Dawnrock, southeast of Ihemor

Some account tasked me with protecting his daughter and some important goods (family heirlooms), and escorting them to Stagfalls, to the Southwest -- supposed to be a safe, fortified city, but close to an Orc Stronghold, the roads can be dangerous with bandits and orcs

  

Journey expected to take 4-6 days

  

Boss: **Count Gulizur** -- all half-orc family, noble so he can pay for an escort -- seemed kinda close/tight-lipped not many details just something that needed to be done

Daughter is 16-18, overheard them saying something about her doing well in school.

They don’t hug goodbye, just share a glance

Duaghter: **Senoti**

  

The carriage is nice but nondescript -- he’s trying to keep a lower profile, not secret just lay low.

He’s a ‘pretty big deal’ so has some ‘competitors’

  

‘Don’t get lost, don’t get killed.’

  

I spend the night in a nice inn meditating with Thera -- sound around me grows louder and louder -- it is raining very hard, absolutely pouring.

  

  

Seems to keep to herself, holds a book up to her face, reads the whole time

  

Stagfalls is like a fortress training ground. She’s going there to train/study

  

She is not very interested in studying, just doing it because it’s the path set out before her.

  

She starts telling longer stories and talking to me -- different demeanour than her step-father -- she says she’s met all kinds of my people before, seems to be obviously lying wants to seem worldly and informed.

  

  

She is reading the book Runic Landmarks

  

  

Raining, 1 or 2, horses spooked.

  

Horse on right, dark brown, a bit bigger, is slightly more agitated. They seem ok, just taken aback

  

On the path ahead I see something on the path -- the rain seems to move aside around it in an instant like a crack of lightning. -- the rain in my field of view shifts over to the left, or down and diagonally, moving how it seems it shouldn’t

  

Hear a noise -- weird, guttural, unplaced what could make it -- comes from same spot

  

To the right of me, some movement of water gathers and shoves me to the ground, pushing me back 10’

  

I can’t find any clues, return to the carriage and lead it carefully around

As we move past the shifting water, keep hearing that weird guttural noise -- doesn’t seem to be following

  

Rain has let up, more light raining with mist

  

Bumps in the night -- on my watch I think I see something in the distance, have Thera guard carriage, I approach stealthily

  

It’s 3 bandits, we fight, they’re awful it’s a close battle but we force them to retreat.
