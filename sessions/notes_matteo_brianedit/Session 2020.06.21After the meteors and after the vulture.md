Briza ate a chocolate that make her sad and Holmgren gave her drugs to shut her up But then they got attacked by randoms in an alley so he lesser restoration her and they got their ass kicked anyways but Tablackxi game to save their lives

Lachlan’s lady owner human is named Mz Willow, Gryphon, the black long haired tabaxi from the air ship also knows her, gave her the gem that is in Lachlan’s collar -- that’s why she didn’t mug Lachlan.

THEY THOUGHT LACHLAN STOLE THE COLLAR FROM HER THAT’S WHY THEY FOLLOWED AND ATTACKED HIM, THEY DIDN’T REALIZE SHE GAVE IT TO HIM, THANKS FOR THE INFO VOLA

Vola manages to get off vulture and joins lachlan

Vola passes a 10% off fancy pet store Bugs, Bears, and Beyond, on their walk back to tavern

I join halfway in.

Holmgren and Briza get attacked by roof people -- guards told them to clear the roads so they went into alley and got attacked by some gang. Black Tabaxi helps them as does some unseen person on roof. Some crazy light descends from the heavens to help them -- IT’S ZANZIBAR!

  

Varenzais Adventure:

-   Gets to gate: Cannot find any information on Tora or find that Tour guard
    
-   Lots of commotion and chaos, tons of people who were just visiting the city or whatever and are trying to get out, but city is under lockdown, guards holding them in
    
-   Among the chaos there’s a wide circle around a Roc that is causing a commotion, bucking and restless -- a young small Firbolg woman and Pale faced man are trying to control her but it’s not working
    
-   Varenzai walks up with Thera, clicking to communicate, and manages to pacify the Roc -- Firbolg is very impressed
    
    -   Roc = Lulu -- very small for a Roc, size of a large eagle
        
    -   Firbolg = Nemo
        
    -   Pale-faced man = Caius -- Vampire
        
-   Nemo is very bright and bubbly, Caius is stoic and sort of apathetic to what’s going on but they’re all together
    
-   Nemo links arms with Varenzai and walks with him, explains they’re with the airship, trying to get out of city to let Lulu fly around because she’s restless (they don’t want to let a giant predatory hawk fly freely within the city, but guards won’t let them out)
    
-   They walk back to tavern all together
    

  

Briza and Holmgren:

-   Black Tabaxi & Zanzibar save them, they walk back to tavern -- Briza seems to make friends with Black Tabaxi
    
-   They walk back to the tavern
    
    -   Black Tabaxi = Urk
        

  

Back in the Tavern

-   Briza does not like Nemo -- wants to be the only bubbly one (THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE)
    
-   Varenzai gets Nemo a drink, Briza gets jealous and Holmgren gets salty
    
-   Holmgren gets himself kicked out of the Inn and has to walk out all saltily
    
-   A lot of the crew is there with us -- Gryphon starts talking with Lachlan about Mz. Willow, his former owner -- Gryphon is asking questions about her, where is she now for some reason, they say they gave her the collar she gave Lachlan
    
-   They say they last saw her at Sundertos Port, and Lachlan says he remembers a ship the Drunkard’s Waltz
    

Lachlan is from Sundertos Port (big, beautiful, coastal, “people write romantic stories about it”, big trading port, lots of opportunity, very glamorous, pirates and things like that, adventurous, people talk about it but it might be stories”)

Ashkeeper’s Grove -- where Ms. Willow is buried

Lulu seems to have a close bond with Gryphon

Varenzai stays behind to chat and drink with the crew, Brzia stays too, Lachlan and Vola leave to look for Holmgren. Zanzibar quietly left after him too. They realize Holmgren went to the Sun and Cidre, Vola yells into bar they’re going there, Lorca gets really excited about this and says they all have to go.
