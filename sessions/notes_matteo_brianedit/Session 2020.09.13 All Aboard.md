DRAGONFIGHT

It crushed, Vola crits it with big shot

  

The Emptied Isle, Full of Dragons, donâ€™t let just anyone in

Drakken -- Dragonborn of Emptied Isle, name for themselves, really hate elves, even half-elves

Ruler: The Tiamat, chosen lineage, not hereditary -- female drakken born and chosen (divinely) to be The Tiamat, not allowed to have children/relationships

  

## Late Addendums

This was 5 weeks ago so who remembers what happened, notable:

Lachlan talked a lot to **Gryffon, Mrs. Willows** anda cool book

**Briza** climbed a mast and got yelled at by **Urk**

**Yonder** threw a knife at someone and got in trouble

Shenanigans of some sort? Definitely various drug shenanigans.

**Holmgren** and **Jadzia** had some serious talk, hugged at the end? Break up or reassurances?
