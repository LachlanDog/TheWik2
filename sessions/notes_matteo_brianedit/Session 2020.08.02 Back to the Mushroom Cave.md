**Recap:** Raven’s Grove, port city south of Orillon

Mayor’s daughter is missing. People of town really like him, but travellers passing through have a lot of disdain for him because he has a giant faded Tiamat face tattoo (but has since reformed to Bahamut). Mayor got daughter a bunch of books, a few days later she shot him with a fireball and ran off into the woods.

We meet a guardian mushroom, Taki, tasked with looking after these mushrooms of this cave, Ruru leads us on.

We get to a final chamber and encounter baddies. Some mighty chain demon, a fire dog, and what Jerome later concludes to be an incubus. Fight them, Taki banishes the demon, eventually we get the incubus to run. Find the mayor’s daughter asleep on some moss pile by an evil portal that Jerome closes, with a book akin to Tom Riddle’s diary that made her do it all (she got it from Rose at the General Store).

Ruru reveals she was also working with the Incubus because he promised her she would be supreme leader, but she didn’t really understand and will die in 10 days anyways.

We safely return the mayor’s daughter and leave the book with him.

  

Important names (but I don’t remember who for)

Dendar -- The mayor?

Psilofyr -- I think the main mushroom guy we first encountered.
