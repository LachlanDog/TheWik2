We come back in the fight right where we left off, Jadzia had gone down and Krampus kept attacking so she had 2 failed death saves -- Holmgren immediately healed her.

  

Fight happens, I kick more ass, eventually they banish Krampus -- but Lachlan immediately freely walks into a wall of fire and passes out, bringing Krampus back.

  

Vola and Jadzia knock me out, and fight ends with them banishing krampus again, along with Vola’s Hammer, Holmgren’s Sword, and any potential christmas loot.

They tie me up while I’m unconscious and try waking me up. I immediately call out for Krampus and sing their curses so they knock me right back out (24 hour effect to be cured of Krampus).

  

Lachlan tries to talk to Jadzia and she’s typically cagey. Holmgren kicks me while I’m down. Vola gets a cool ring and mopes about her hammer. Briza thinks of eating a chocolate
