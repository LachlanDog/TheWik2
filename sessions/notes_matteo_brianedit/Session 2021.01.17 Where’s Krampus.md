They’re not really sure what to do about us.

Vola suggests Jadzia try Dispel Magic on me, Jadzia hasn’t thought of that and is proud of Vola for the suggestion.

She casts it, but because I’m unconscious, they’re unsure of the result.

In the meantime, Holmgren walks around looking for signs of Krampus, popping off some Divine Senses -- gets a read on Briza of something, but doesn’t tell anyone yet

After a few hours, I wake up still in love with Krampus, they knock me back out, and try damaging me with a Krampus weapon instead

  

They decide to rest here the night and try feeding me something in the morning.

In the meantime, Jadzia tries to connect Vola with her parents

  

Vola has a conversation with Billy the Rabbit, a local Arctic Hare, using her Laparine helmet. She gets some info about the nearby Frost Giants, and asks for some rope.

  

Jadzia’s watch comes and she casts the spell on Vola. Vola goes to some dreamscape described like 11 going into her trance, and manages to communicate with her mother.

  

Vola describes parts of our adventure to her mom, hears that the war has brought hard times for them, but a good challenge for her father, tells her about hammer and needing a new one, asks about her old friend, ‘Bren’? Mom, **Olive**, says she has heard stories about her, that she went to an apprenticeship in Sime Tolic, and is now in Kim Fal’Dhour, working under Nathalas Snowbeard.

They continue having an adorable touching conversation, Vola says she misses them, Olive says ‘I say this because I love you, but I don’t think this place misses you. You were never meant to stay here whittling your time away, that makes your dad and I happy, but you were meant to go do great things.’

  

## The Following Day

Varenzai finally wakes up normal, doesn’t remember anything, but they describe to him. He is horrified but the party actually sort of reassures him, happy to have him back.

The Jarl is the same as before.

  

We debate a bit what to do with the Jarl, decide on trying to get in touch with Vakkmigr and telling him to come to us. He says something about ‘Jarl Melfy has killed everyone’ apparently she’s jarl of a rival clan and has come in and brutally murdered this clan.

  

## Riding the Wind

We decide our best bet is to head toward the Frost Giant Fortress, we think that’s our best bet of where to find Vakkmigr, Jadzia turns us all into ‘wind’ and Briza leads us as clouds to the fortress.

  

Briza trolls us as we fly leading us in many winding directions, we eventually see the Bodhur mountain range and a fortress, very blue.

“You can’t communicate, you can’t talk to each other as wind.”

  

As we get closer we see many many Frost Giant bodies lying in the snow, Briza recognizes a lot of them.

  

The fortress is made of and lined with Dragon Bones.

  

Briza takes us to some hideout cave place she had about an hour from the fortress. There’s about 8 hours left in the day so we debate what to do, Briza just wants to rest until Jadzia can get in touch with Vakkmigr again. Jadzia and I decide to scout out ahead towards the fortress and see what we can see.

  

We don’t really see much, get to the bodies, they seem to have been dead for a few days, maybe a week.

We find a herd of mammoths nearby in proximity of the fort

No real signs of activity at or around the fort, but the trails seem to lead in and up to it.

We get back, night passes generally uneventfully, some small bird comes that Vola sees but Varenzai misses.

  

For the most part, the other watches pass mostly uneventfully -- until on Briza’s, she sees some elf-like creature near the edge of camp, about 80’ away, blue sallow skin, white pupiless eyes. She yells for its attention then waves at it, it waves back, but doesn’t speak.

  

The elf asks what we’re doing and how many friends she has. Briza says we’re looking for Thera and as many as she can get. The elf says their name is **Kala** and they are looking. The elf knows of Vakkmigr but not personally

  

**Kala** wants Briza to show them around inside the fortress, says they’ll take us to the godvale if she does. Kala says they are from a big city.

  

## Into the Fortress

The next morning we discuss a bit what to do. We can’t get in touch with Vakkmigr through Jadzia’s spell. We decide to help Kala into the fortress, I pinky promise Briza I won’t let Jarl Melfi eat her.

  

We go to the fortress entrance and Briza waves to Kala. As she approaches I notice what seems to be an Arboreal use Transport by Plant on a tree to leave the perimeter area, like it was watching us.

**Kala** wears very fancy armour, some sort of Elven Mithril. Able to cast spells.

  

We ask Kala about the Godvale and stuff, she tells us she can take us there, most people know where it is, the trouble is accessing it:

Godvale is a test, trouble isn’t getting there, it’s getting an audience, they can’t guarantee we’ll survive the audience but can probably get us one. Test to give you what you want. “Was she of this plane originally?”

Kala is from Nythm’Thalas

Arboreals all over, keep to themselves, goodhearted

Personal interest in the fortress

  

As we go into the fortress its littered with bodies, Briza recognizes some, does not like them.

Massive massive cavern lined by giant dragon bones.

Keep going into large massive cavernous places, some where Briza hadn’t been able to go before or some where she could get but the giants could have

Some horrific smells and such around where the Frost Giants tore bones like fortune cookies

  

Kala is most interested in the areas where Briza couldn’t go

### From Insight Check:

-   She’s clearly looking for something specific and powerful/magical in the fortress.
    
    -   Most interested in the closed door Briza is describing that she couldn’t get through
        
    -   She’s giving a polite interest to the other thing Briza is saying, but is most interested in that.
        
-   Probably heard from scouting reports or something what had happened at the fortress, and that it was more easily accessible now.
    
    -   Some militaristic/driven character about them.
        
-   Godvale is in Nythm’Thalas, the audience we seek has to be with the king there.
    
    -   Some hint of sadness when they spoke of it, as if they sought something from it and were unsuccessful in trying to gain it.
        
-   They genuinely did recognize Briza, they’re somewhat older for an elf and the way they said I know you was more with a sense of nostalgia, like remembering someone they knew from a long time ago
    

  

### From Persuasion Check (What are you looking for)

-   They promise they will take it, not a threat, but even if we try keeping it from them or whatever, they will leave with them
    
-   Looking for a magic orb and a magic sickle
    

  

  

  

We get to a room that’s mostly stone, some ice, as though the raw side of the mountain. It was Briza’s quarters, distant from the main hall, very not nice place, a sort of ‘we hate you so go live over there’ Harry Potter under the stairs type deal

  

  

As we continue in we get to a very fancy door with some markings on it, this is the door Briza could never get through when exploring

  

The engravings are in Celestial, Holmgren is (finally) able to read it. It says something about the formation of the world, the primordial gods coming together to make it, they fear one things

Men desire me in public and fear me in private.

  

“In the time before time, the gods sprang fully formed from the primeval void. All these ﬁrst gods were equally endowed with the power of the cosmos, and each claimed jurisdiction over certain aspects of the universe. In a spirit of cooperation that has not been seen since, they built the worlds together, separating matter from energy, land from sea, and sky from earth. They only fear one thing.

Men alike desire me in public, but fear me in private.”

  

Briza has a flask of dirt.

  

Kala ends up being the smart one, casts Tongues or something on herself, and says “The Truth” in celestial, allowing the door to open.

  

We go into an old-timey like study, so many quills and books with old bindings. A pedestal on the left has a cloth covering something circular.

Beside it, near desk, some sort of shattered glass crystal thing that looks like it once had something in it now gone.

  

Behind desk is a mummified, at least dead for 100 years, emaciated, wearing a fine scholars robe with gold embroidery, greyish skinned, older version of Briza, not just like related, but looks exactly like Briza. Same hair and everything but not blue.

ASK KALA HOW SHE KNOWS BRIZA AND WHAT THIS IS AND DO SOME CHECK ON THE BODY  
Theory: Based on how it seems like Kala knows another version of Briza, and what we saw with Aloy, is it possible Briza did the same sort of thing, making and inhabiting a clone body, but for some reason she doesn’t remember. And this is the old one?

Theory 2 (unrelated): Kala is here looking for things related to whatever made them fail in what they were trying to get from the Godvale.

  

Jerome tried to contact Vola saying he’s trying to reach Jadzia, apparently he’s already tried to contact Holmgren but he just didn’t say anything.
