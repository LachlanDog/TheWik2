# Session: 17.05.2020: Save Holmgren

We level up.

Vola takes Holmgren to the Temple of the Everlight (god is Raei) -- Human, Ara, is head priestess

Temple to the Lord of Plants Dardiel: in Brightring District

  

The cult girl Gloria: writes a lot of letters (but they’re super creepy) she wants to sell her wedding dress, signs letters with different names, involved blood in one? Kept calling the guard Caleb but his name is John

Vanuth (human) was waiting for us back at Tavern, wanted to talk to Briza.

-   Apparently she’s the arcane leader of the council.
    

Everyone hates each other now

-   Lachlan got a mysterious message from an old contact of his and Holmgren’s. It seemed very different that the others. Tora and Holmgren determined it was forged or counterfeit.
    
-   Jeff decoded a hidden message within it about ‘Someone is trying to kill you. A woman with light hair will try to take you away and kill you.’
    
    -   someone is trying to kill You or bring you somewhere a woman with light hair came searching for You a predator, knows A hunter Do Not trust her Run Run."
        
-   Varenzai got suspicious and told the party about the times he saw in the vision for when people would die. This pissed Tora off, she ran up to tell Holmgren, they talked then came down and cast Zone of Truth.
    
-   Tora got very mad at Varenzai for not trusting her and accepting her into the party, and the party had a heart to heart and we shared all our secrets
