# Session 10.05.2020: Holmgren’s Sister

Mr. Noc = new scranton in Ko’Themar, city councillor

Zanzibar = HOLMGREN’S SISTER -- EDIT LATER 07.06.2020 : SHE’s PROBABLY EVIL

-   Also Asimar
    
-   About same age, slightly younger, but looks much younger and very youthful -- was lost in Astral plane where she didn’t age
    
-   Has been looking for Holmgren her whole life with her parents
    
-   Came to take Holmgren to claim his ‘birthright’ -- that quest and other stuff isn’t as important -- this is annoying Tora
    

Nora -- half-elf girl who works in Daveed’s shop

Sable -- short human woman in Daveed’s shop, annoyed -- OH SHIT THAT WAS Ly’Ara in disguise!!!

When we went to see Daveed some half-orc left in a huff

Ly’Ara is Daveed’s wife!!!!!

He wants us to sign some book to join his worldwide secret organisation in return for protection from the veil

**COMPANY ZERO**

Nora is Daveed and Ly’Ara’s daughter -- EDIT LATER 07.06.2020: Who was Carmella? Also daughter?

As the session ended, Holmgren offered Daveed a bottle of wine we had stolen from the sewer. Daveed siked it aside at the last minute as Holmgren drank it -- told us it was torture wine, Holmgren will be paralysed and in anguish for the next day.
