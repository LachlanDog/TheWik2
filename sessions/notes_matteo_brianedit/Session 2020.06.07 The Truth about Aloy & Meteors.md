Start, convince them to regrow my arm in return for interesting anecdotes, we trade some stories -- seems to go well.

Tora is fairly uninterested in al this until Lachlan mentions his heart, then she gets concerned. Roe and Aisha are interested but don’t tell us much.

Briza gets a journal she can write in to keep and touch with them.

We each get a badge, as well as an extra for Vanuth

I give Bort my Weird Metal Spike in Glass Flask as a birthday present… I will miss it.

  

Aisha: warforged

Sylvan Odium hates dogs

OCTAVIUS IS ALOY’S SON!

Aloy backstory session, from Roe

-   Very popular in town, solved everyone’s problem
    
-   Was killed by accident by the king, wild magic accident
    
-   Town had big parade and funeral pyre, very sad when she died
    
-   She was prepared, did some necromancy spell to have a clone of her younger self ready when she died, soul went into that body once she passed. People did not like this, that’s why Octavius is mad at her.
    

Ro regrew my arm!

It’s around 4AM -- some Airship captained by a Tabaxi, Captain Gryphon (Griffin?), lands outside the city, apparently there’s going to be a banquet or some such in his honour.

We decide to go to the speakeasy, Delver’s Den, speakeasy under the Ivory Porceum (under the library), kinda like a university -- that’s what the badges we got for Vanuth are for.

Roxanne, owner of Delver’s Den, attractive french dog, Lachlan and her have a thing

They have some drug and magical impairing effect so things not immediately around us were obscured (like not having my glasses on) and we didn’t really remember ordering drinks or anything.

They had some attractive suggestive dancer doing aerial aerobatics, the White Dove (Roxanne referred to them as ‘it’), looking at her she briefly had a planty appearance -- I (Varenzai) left her one of my blue shoulder flowers on the stage.

  

Now all hell breaks loose:

We get back to Fools Blade Tavern, Ms. S is waiting for us, she’s sad (not really disappointed in us, just sad) that we didn’t move on the quest and kill the guy or whatever she needed done (i’ll never get a handle on this) -- says the trial is today, it probably won’t go her way and we can’t get in cause its a closed trial, but she asks us to come by for a recess at 2 as moral support and sets up a cute moment with Briza, has a present with her -- she definitely gonna die. Veil gonna stage a jailbreak?

Try to make a plan with party about assassinating the guy to help Ms. S and be there if any shenanigans happen.

Most of us go to the courthouse to wait in morning, except Holmgren gets a mysterious letter from Daveed (something about making amends to him or something)

METAGAMING: ONLY holmgren went so we don’t know, but someone (Ly’Ara?) gives him a letter, tells him to deliver it 10 blocks up street and then Company Zero is done with him. We don’t know this.

  

As we get to courthouse, prisoner wagon comes through crowd, Blue dragonborn inside -- Tora breaks out, recognizes him, runs out and has the following conversation in Dwarvish:

She calls him: Bolero

**He calls her: Jad’zeeya = Tora**

“I was trying to get up the fucking mountain” -- B

“I’m not like Jerome, I’m not some fucking messiah, I don’t care about the means to this end, I care about the end.” -- B

“I got it, I have the conch, it’s in my room” -- B

At some point they switched to Draconic but I still understood.

Confront Tora about this after, she’s very upset and runs off for a bit but then come back -- we speak in Sylvan, not to hide from party but just passerbys

She knows this guy, somehow related to her and Jerome -- says he shouldn’t be in there and do not assassinate him (that’s why I asked in Sylvan)

I try to reassure her that we’re her friends and want to help her with and through this but we don’t know tf is going on -- I guess that it’s something about they had some club or were all friends in High School, learned about the artifacts and grouped together to find them, either for power or something (and so maybe she’s not fully honest about all of their intentions with them) -- she says this isn’t too far off from the truth (not the not being honest part, just the friends trying to find artifacts) and her and Varenzai share their first kind of nice moment

  

Young woman blue robes and book, old man, little girl in cloak with basket and flowers (girl Ly’Ara told Holmgren to give letters to?) go up the courthouse, girl goes up to Ms. S, gives her a red letter with something red inside

Briza and I notice a whistling and little black specks in the sky -- meteors descend and destroy the courthouse presumably killing everyone inside -- session ends here
