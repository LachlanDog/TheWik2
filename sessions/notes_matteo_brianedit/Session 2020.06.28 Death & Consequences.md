We start walking from The Fool’s Blade to the Sun & Cidre to try and find where Holmgren stormed off to.

Lachlan & Gryphon very quiet, Lach just learned about his owner lady, apparently had son who died with Gryphon who he’s named after.

From Fireside Chat: Nemo Home

-   Very green forest, in Northern Continent(?)
    
-   Crystal Tree with special fruits
    
-   Her dad is in charge, only speaks Old Sylvan
    
-   Have to be ‘good’(?)
    

  

We get to the Sun & Cider. Our Motely Chaos Crew does not impress and we learn nothing.

Holmgren trips out in his room. Has a drug vision of Zanzibar, she brought him a head in a bag -- the decayed head of Laddy Mook, his headmistress from the orphanage.

While we’re in the lobby a torrent of water comes from upstairs -- like a pipe burst or bath broke. Chaos and panic.

Varenzai confirms Holmgren is well and leaves back for the Fool’s Blade, he wants to sleep.

Nemo plays in the water and Briza secretly freezes her.

Gryphon seems afraid of the water

Vola & Briza &Nemo do a good performance at the tavern on Ocarina & Flutes before leaving

Vola & Briza try smoking cigarettes

  

Back at the Fool’s Blade

We all leave the Sun & Cider together, including Holmgren who’s finding somewhere else to sleep

Roxanne meets Lachlan at our tavern and they go on their date

Varenzai asks Apilin if he’s heard anything about Tora, he says no so Varenzai goes to bed

Vola also goes to bed

Briza stays down drinking with the crew and offers them drugs.

Briza finds out that officially the crew are here to help advise on the potential creation of a new Skyport in Ko’Themar, but Nemo implies there’s more to that.

Nemo gets wasted and laments that her imaginary friend in grade 2 wouldn’t be her friend

Nemo’s dad is ‘god of the forest’ -- urk takes her to bed. “The forest moves cause it has legs and it walks around, you’ll never find it!”

Lorca was hitting on Briza before realising Briza had no clue what was going on, then pulled back when she realised Briza had only been around people for 3 weeks.

People are blaming elves of Nym’Thalas for attack on courthouse

Hawthorne, leader of the Spellbinder’s Guildhall (who veil said was evil) survived the attack

  

In our Room at the Fool’s Blade

Vola, Thera, & I get to bed, get a short rest. Briza comes in and goes to bed. Two assassins sneak into the room and murder Briza in her sleep before she wakes up.

We try to fight them, Vola absolutely destroys one and erases his existence. The other we damage but they slip out, we try to chase and track.

  

Lachlan’s Date

Roxanne takes him to some awesome magic speakeasy through a portal, seems real cool.

They have a great time and head out somewhere more intimate

  

Back in the Room

Varenzai & Thera go after the surviving assassin, Vola goes back and alerts Inn, gets Lorca, Urk is with the body. Finds Reeree eating Briza’s platinum and nothing but a special assassin knife on the body.

Holmgren gets there, they do the ritual, Holmgren and Vola nap, Vola dumbs reeree in a bathtub with some money and stuff. They revive Briza successfully.

  

THE VEIL!!!!!!! CAUSE BRIZA WASN’T PROTECTED BY COMPANY ZERO

Varenzai chases the guy to the sewers and gives him chase through them but eventually loses him, makes his way back home.

We manage to get home, Varenzai watches over Thera with Briza, and they Finally get a long rest!!

  

  

Something about a banquet?!? Fill this in

Invitation from Mrs. S to a Banquet at the ‘Jade Chateau’, this has to do with getting over the pass

2 Days to banquet?

Fancy social event, chance to meet and schmooze all the councillors. They’re not voting on letting us through then, it’s just a chance to see them all and stuff.

  

Things to do next:

-   Find Tora
    
-   Revenge on/Safety from the Veil
    
-   Work with Mrs. S, ensure her safety
    
-   Where did Greyson go? (Relates to Veil stuff)
    
-   Get through to Nym’Thalas (no point doing this without Tora)
