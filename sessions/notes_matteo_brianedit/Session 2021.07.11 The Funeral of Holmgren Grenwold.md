## FIGHT

Clay comes to us from the scene of a horror movie.

Vola manages to drag him out of the darkness

  

Holmgren straight up fuckin’ dies.

Varenzai goes down trying to save Lachlan

Unicorns are cool, celestial beings that tend towards being good.

Lachlan summons a devil, clearly it's incredibly uncomfortable in this land but it does what he says

Fight finally ends, final demon runs away, Vola gets me back up

Holmgren is dead, some debate over whether I have a spell slot left but we decide not.

  

Unicorn says she could maybe bring Holmgren back, but we need to sacrifice something -- not a thing necessarily, but how she had us agree not to lie for a month to bring Jadzia back -- some sort of inherently good personal sacrifice.

## Saving Holmgren

Lachlan tries to offer to surrender his personal quest for vengeance to kill the person who killed his master.

-”A life for a life is a trade. But, I have already given you a life, but you have already taken.”

“I will accept your proposal, with an addition. You must do as you say, but you must also dedicate yourself to instilling this same value as him *points to Holmgren* within your lifetime.”

LACHLAN GOTTA BECOME HOLMGREN’S SPIRIT GUIDE -- stop his quest for revenge against the spirit guardian.

  

Lachlan agrees and Holmgren immediately wakes back up.

## Aftermath and Loot

Dusk Eladrin -- creatures of the queen’s court of shadow and darkness and apathy. Sees no value in life, and highly trained to fulfill any task on her behalf.

-   Investigation Roll: The way they were moving, always surrounded by wisp and shadow, unsure exactly where the physical form is, but I find one. No blood. The more time that passes, the more the shadow just slightly dissipates.
    
-   Appearance of a very dark elf with this melancholy aura around it, even in death
    
-   A Dusk Eladrin is an elf that has gone down a very dark path
    
-   LOOT:
    
    -   Mithril Half-Plate Armour (Medium Armour (15+2 dex AC), doesn’t impose disadvantage on dex) -> Varenzai
        
    -   +3 Longsword -> Vola -> Holmgren
        
    -   Boots of springing and striding -> Holmgren
        
    -   Ring of Elemental Command -> Lachlan
        
    -   Sovereign Glue ->Briza
        
    -   Magic Dagger -> Varenzai
        

We kind of sit and discuss and decompress, dividing the loot among us.

  

Varenzai collects 4 Doombloom Flowers

Asks Urithana if the goblins are ok if there’s anything we could do

-   They have suffered great losses, but they will go on. You can be there for them but be as they will.
    

  

Varenzai seems the animals, they’re stressed but ok, tries to pacify them, gets some ok but can’t do much

## Doombloom, trying to Scry Elyra

Nature Check on Doomblooms:

-   Nothing to do to preserve them, they’ll last for 9 days
    

  

Varenzai finds a quiet area, sniffs one and whispers in the name “Elyra”.

Sweet sweet candy-type spell -- reminds of Briza, try to hear my thoughts with the visions of my friend

Everything feels very disjointed, can’t really focus on them -- hear voices, but they sound disjointed

Visions of thousands and thousands of people, not necessarily people I know, not Entheri, but I hear all kinds of voices from everywhere, gets very very disjointed and painful, piercing, builds, and I take a large amount of Psychic Damage and feel pained.

The petal I plucked to activate the effect fades, and the flower explodes -- assume spell failed, she’s not on this plane.

  

## Others

Lachlan goes to see Bufflewump

Vola collects some goodberries, trades teaching them Red Rover for 5 bottles of Goodberry Wine

  

## Moving Forward

Aurene is fine, determine what to do with her -- seems like I could leave her here, or I could bring her with and try raising.

  

## THE AWAKENING OF JADZIA

Jadzia awakens, Holmgren goes there first. He starts to explain things, but she FREAKS OUT when she learns we’re in the Feywild, and wants to get out immediately.

Tries to immediately get up and get going, goes through her stuff, learns she was in the Bag of Holding

  

She comes out, won’t tell us much but clearly wants to get right out, but agrees we could long rest, but wants to get out soon.

Varenzai says ‘that’s twice we’ve saved your life now’, she does not take it well.

They decide not to long rest instead, so we get ready to set out, I just need to figure what to do with Aurene.

  

## Final Talk with Urithana

Aurene -- will almost certainly die if left in the wastes

If I left her there, she wouldn’t exactly ‘raise’ her, would feed her and make sure she survives but that’s it

No guarantees for if I choose to keep and raise her -- this is what I chose

  

I ask about reuniting, in particular note I don’t know much about travelling between planes -- she says neither do they, and my best hope at ‘reuniting, whatever that may mean to you’ would be to ‘change their minds’

No real technical advice on how to actually contact them, but that felt reassuring.

## Leaving the Feywild

We arrange to ride the Skurja from Urithana’s to the Candlemaker, tender of the portal back to the material plane. To get to the portal we’d need to do a perilous swim through frozen water.

  

We move at a fast pace, Varenzai trying to lead the group and scout ahead. Skurja would telepathically talk to us, humming tunes and songs, like Tom Bombadil.

  

He’ll sing a song about the terror wolves we had visions of, finishing his song as we get to some creepy magic forest, willow wisps, the ‘candles’

We get to the candlemaker, and receive GIFTS from the goblins, and a poem from the dude!

  

### Erna Poem

**Erna is the Skurja**

Erna heard a poem once about these wolves:

“Howler Howler, caterwaul,

Piercing shriek, cantankerous call,

  

Listen Listen move through stone

Sightless silence, never alone

Blinding poison, noxious breeze

Veiled shadow amongst the trees

  

Weeping wolf who rules the night

Eyes in the dark and never the light

Spirit prison, eat despair

Has no need of food or air

Die too close, another eye

Living nightmare, final cry

I wish I may, I wish I might

A spirits chance to flee the bite”
