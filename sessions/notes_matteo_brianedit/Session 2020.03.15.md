Mechanus: Start with peyote trips.

Hot Orc’s (Vakgar) sister will be our guide? Her name is Grossie

-   Vakgar works in building 17
    
-   Grossie is also hot
    
-   Thief/artificer thing? Badass, knows her way around, likes mechanus
    

**PEYOTE TRIPS:**

-   Varenzai:
    
    -   Heard a noise that sounds like Thera
        
    -   Heard childhood best friend, remembered romping through wilderness -- eventually as their voice fades he recalls that ill fated jump when I died.
        
    -   Can see numbers above everyone's head for how much time they have left alive:
        
        -   Lachlan: [REDACTED]
            
        -   Vola: [REDACTED] “full half orc life”
            
        -   Tora: [REDACTED]
            
        -   Holmgren: [REDACTED]
            
-   Varenzai Appearance: Basically GW2 Varenzai, short microgreenesque stubble, leafy hair, some blossoms around shoulder and neck. Wilted and brittle after peyote trip.
    

  

Lachlan’s portal always opens in the same part of Mechanus…

Grossie’s home:

-   Really cool place! Lots of herbs and stuff and plants dried and living hanging. Big meat spinning on spit. Bead door to small room.
    
-   Lots of fish in bowls.
    
-   3 HALF orcs come and go: Grossie, Vakgar, and an older male Half-Orc
    

Octavius:

-   Half-Orc man in Ko’Themar that Aloy told us to look up if we need help (but not mention her to him)
    

Aloy’s needs her body burnt to be her bff but it may have already been burnt

Ko’Themar:

-   Lots of dwarven monuments, six ones facing away from the city
    
-   Lots of Blue Arctic Roses -- a stoic flower native to the region
    
-   Different districts have cool names: fancier one, crafting one, arcane one
    
    -   Different tavern options, many types, spas, baths, brothels:
        
        -   Fools blade: mid/lower range -- this is where we’re staying
            
        -   Brightcastle: Higher end
            
        -   Velvet Pillow: Brothel
            
-   Temple
    
    -   A priest or something named Gull sent me to the Prodigal manner (grand temper), or some shrine in the Hell hound district
        
    -   Its super naturey and druidy there are birds and I like them
        
    -   Temple to the Lord of Plants
