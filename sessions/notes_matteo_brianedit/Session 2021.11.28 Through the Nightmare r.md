    

# Session: 28.11.2021: Through the Nightmare

We begin with review & then Vola’s commune with nature (3 questions answered)

-   She senses a fiend about 300’ above us.
    
-   Nowhere within 3 miles that other planes are bleeding in
    
-   Beasties nearby?
    

  

We all look straight up -- above us are like rolling clouds and constantly shifting light -- twilight, dim, light, flash of lightning.

No visible creature above us when we look

  

We decide to take a short rest, Varenzai will be wary during it

  

We march onwards unto the storm -- cautiously but not so stealthily

-   Varenzai tries to dream up a canopy of cover for us to walk under but nothing happens
    

Landscape shifts around us -- at some point a giant marble rolls in front of us

  

As we walk on Briza is pensive, and confused seeming -- is this the dream she stole from the Winter Court’s daughter, is that this queen or because of that?

But we think this is tied to Zanzibar.

  

The storm is far far away -- about a “day’s” walk (what is time here?) -- still the only thing that really seems constant, doesn’t really seem to be other patterns?

  

We debate the way forward

-   Try to long rest?
    
-   Beat someone unconscious?
    
    -   Not preferred option
        
-   Banishment?
    

  

Varenzai brings up that we might want to deal with the Rakshasha, but the others, especially Holmgren and Lachlan seem to think it’s no issue, that they’re here incidentally and we have other concerns. Varenzai thinks they brought us here for a reason, and any way forward is tied to that but oh well.

  

Rakshasas:

-   Type of **fiend**
    
-   If you kill them its torturous/agonizing -- but they then return to where they’re from, and reform seeking revenge
    
-   You need to kill them in the 9 hells to truly kill them
    

  

Briza starts dreaming things up and it all manifests -- she flies, a tree appears, she heals her wounds

She cannot change Lachlan

  

They can all dream things up except Varenzai and have fun with it

Briza dreams the best creamiest ice cream she’s ever had

  

Lachlan dreams a version of the tower from the first solo duels that I had hidden in, and bears in armour with bow & arrows to guard it. He takes the first watch up top

  

Vola sleeps floating in the midair

Holmgren dreams up a hammock to sleep in

Vola dreams up a pillow for Varenzai but he finds it unsatisfying

  

**New Commune**

-   Rakshasha is still around, but further, like 1km away
    

  

**Primeval Awareness**

-   No beasts, humanoids or dragons
    

  

  

**The Dreamless Night**

We all take watches, nothing happens. The bears mark their shifts on a punchcard at each long walk.

  

On Varenzai’s watch, he takes a piece of his old leather armour and tries idly carving into it, some old Entheri designs he remembers from his vision, reflecting on the past.

  

We all wake up feeling refreshed and normal -- somewhat more in tune with the world around, and time itself.

  

  

**Setting Out Again**

We start to head off, all seems normal

Holmgren tries Remove Curse on Lachlan -- he poofs away! But holmgren still feels him

Lachlan makes his head reappear and is like ‘Did it work?!’ trickster that he is

  

Holmgren misty steps and it seems to work

Briza chastises him for wasting spells

  

A GIANT bag of holding appears phasing out from under the ground. Three of them climb aboard. Eventually Vola & I join

  

More things seem to appear -- they seem more real & corporeal than anything else we’ve encountered here

  

**The Vision**

  

We seem to hear some sort of shuffling sound all around us, like something twisting on itself

  

I look over the side of the ground (perception check) and the ground seems very far away, like we’re very high up now. The sound it seems like is coming all around us, like we’re in a sphere, like walking through one of the visions we walked through before. It’s like we’re inside a giant version of one of the visions, but it hasn’t fully shifted yet.

  

I hear crying -- lot’s of crying, like loss

People talking over each other, very solemn, like reading something, very heavy, solemn sorrowful

Tons of people in a graveyard, kneeling over different graves

Background and landscape -- very familiar blue roses of Ko’Themar

Large memorial, some people we recognize

People we recognize based on who’s there, this is a memorial for the victims of the attack.

People crying, leaving things at grave. Mrs. S is there.

We put this all together pretty quickly. After ~30 seconds, the landscape starts to shift again. A hand breaks through the frozen permafrost ground, and reaches up. Zombie-people rise from each of the graves, and start to attack people.

But then they turn to look at all of us, the air gets colder. The rest of the vision fades away and they’re in front of us.

  

**Lachlan** hears the sound of rocking, like a boat rocking in the water. But it’s very empty, feels like there should be laughing, talking, but there’s a very noticeable silence. A bird lands on it, but then immediately goes off, like fuck this place. Someone inside, with a lantern, like a white silhouette.

The door opens, and it’s not a person, but a ghost! A very ethereal, almost dripping version of Mrs. Willows. She’s running her hand along the boat, kind of looking slowly mournfully going around. Then she looks right at Lachlan.

  

**Holmgren & Vola:** An intense battlefield, destroyed land, fighting, fires, corpses strewn out, dead and injured horses left to rot. But this isn’t a memory -- they both recognize this as the land around Kurnfeldur. Holmgren recognizes someone [[Ivan Grev]] -- he has pompous armour on, very well decorated, fighting. Vola recognizes past him Breine, as a soldier, in armour, infantry, fighting. On the point about to collapse. The front of her is covered in arrows, she seems like she can’t go on anymore. She wails out, and collapses. In a wispy form she’s on the ground, tries to pull an arrow out of her, but can’t

  

  

All of these visions overlay and happen over one another. More things like giant floating potion bottles and stuff float around us.

  

Vola “This isn’t real like? This isn’t actually happening.”

  

Lachlan takes off running towards Mrs. Willows. The ship in the background kind of fades, but she looks down at him, like he’s really there.

  

We somewhat recognize Mrs. Willows as Lachlan has described her and we’ve seen her in the vision.

  

Lachlan keeps going forward but his steps seem heavier and heavier. HE can’t really figure out why, but as we watch he ages 8 years.

  

Holmgren gets out his wings and goes after him, picks him up to bring him back. Lachlan fights him the whole time, stabs him with his dagger

  

The soldier holmgren friend dude (Ivan Greve) fired an arrow at Holmgren, hits him in the back.

Other than that, the rest of the visions just stand still and watch, and wait.

  

Over the bag we can’t see ground below anymore.

  

Holmgren pops off a divine sense

-   Sense Breine as undead as well as the zombies
    
-   Senses Rakshasha below us
    

  

Holmgren tells Varenzai to shoot them, but he says he doesn’t want to do anything to make this real

So naturally, he and Briza start attacking the zombies

Lachlan slips free

  

Varenzai especially distinctly gets a feeling of time passing -- like we’re losing control or sense even, like it’s flowing more than normal

  

Varenzai shouts off the bag ‘come up here and face us yourself you coward!’ to the rakshasha

  

Holmgren just flies over and starts wailing on a zombies

This triggers everything to kick off

Holmgren murders a dead child zombie

  

Mrs. Willows runs over as Holmgren runs to her, and lets out a terrible scream. We all age more:

Lachlan & Vola by 1 year

Varenzai by 4 years

Briza by 5 years

  

Vola flies over and tries to see Briene

Takes a shit ton of damage from something. Breine Seems like she’s trying to get herself up off the ground but can’t get up.Vola holds position

  

Holmgren gets attacked by zombies & his old friend.

  

Briza flies off the edge to go look for the Fiend, and lo & behold, the Rakshasha is floating in a lotus pose right below the bag. She tries to do some sort of Dispel Evil thing but the Rakshasha ties the save and stays.

  

Lachlan is able to snap himself out of his thing, and casts banishment on Mrs. Willow, banishing her.

  

> [[Session 2021.11.28 Through the Nightmare r]] -> [[briza]] | 2022-01-17
> The Rakshasha looks over at Briza, grabs her, and says ‘Do you really think it’s been enough **TIME**’, and then Power Word: Kills her.


  

I go fly down, fumble a bit but fly with alicorn and grab Briza’s body

Rakshasha does a little wave and disappears

  

Vola floats down, Briene scratches her on the way, but she goes by -- but can’t find Rakshasha, they’re gone.
