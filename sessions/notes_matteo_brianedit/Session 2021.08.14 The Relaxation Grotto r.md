## Flashback: Lachlan Filling in Holmgren on the Deal


---

[[Session 2021.08.14 The Relaxation Grotto r]] -> [[Lachlan]] | 2022-01-17
Brian remembers he wants to fill Clay in on the deal Lachlan made to save Holmgren

-   They do a quick description and RP of how/when it happened
    
    -   They have some weird conversation where Lachlan tries to explain it in a very roundabout way, Holmgren doesn’t seem incredibly receptive
        
    -   I think it’s something like Holmgren will stop killing everyone when he retires

## Back in the Grotto

Ask Big Dragonborn about Nythm’Thalas

Ask Demmi for rooms

Brief conversation about what happened

Talk to Leia -- she was the most recent in Nythm’Thalas

  

They take us to some bedrooms and it’s really sus, the rooms each seem based around us in some way -- Jungle room for Varenzai, Victorian for Holmgren, Beach Themed for Vola/Briza

-   Varenzai deduces that this is not the case, they just have a fascinating array of rooms
    

  

Quarterstaff with many many ribbons, reading a small leather-bound book, very colourful clothing

Elf lady, but some parts that seem a bit odd

‘No heaviness about anything about her’

Very well dressed, in a simple style but good quality, not excessive/ostentatious

Very calm, not the frantic energy of Demmi

[[Session 2021.08.14 The Relaxation Grotto r]] -> [[Nymthalas]] | 2022-01-17
Was very well travelled, ‘well, more now’

The ends of the roads are guarded, especially Nythm’Thalas

-   Small mountain pass -- Belly of the Voiceless Summit
    
-   7 gates protect the city, constant guard, made of different things
    
-   Bounded by dark stone
    
-   ½ day walk at normal speed
    

‘A situation between Nythm’Thalas and some surrounding cities’ Many lives were lost, king was adamant about maintaining this aggression until he reached a certain but king thinks his goal is impossible now, so he’s opening Nythm’Thalas to the world again

Holmgren has a really sweet talk with Varenzai about Thera

  

  

## The Next Morning

Demmi sends us a magic message asking if we’d like breakfast in the hall or in our rooms, we opt for the hall

  

We walk down the large grandiose halls, we pass by many doors. One distinctly has the sound and smells of animals behind.

  

Demmi says its a [[Sloth Sanctuary]], shows us inside -- they’re in perfect conditions, very happy

Boss man, his father, is named **Dimitrius**

[[Session 2021.08.14 The Relaxation Grotto r]] -> [[Demi]] | 2022-01-17
**Demmy is 14**

[[Session 2021.08.14 The Relaxation Grotto r]] -> [[briza]] | 2022-01-17
Briza has a necklace with the name of the daughter of the winter queen court lady in it.

---


  

Takes us to a grand hall where we have a very lavish breakfast, so much food laid out, more than we could eat

  

We have a nice talk at breakfast the next morning going over everything and filling everyone in with what happened.

  

Nythm’Thalas is a mostly wealthy city -- lots about magic and arcane armaments

  

---

[[Session 2021.08.14 The Relaxation Grotto r]] -> [[the Immortal Sanctum]] | 2022-01-17
The Grotto: Like a cathedral, very grandiose, **used to be a temple to a god**, the place is named [[the Immortal Sanctum]]

---

  

The road is very well maintained, quite beautiful, even if not travelled on recently it’s still well kept and beautiful and maintained

  

  

We spend about 4 days resting and waiting here, the days feel very long, not for any magical reason but moreso because we haven’t had a chance to just sit and relax in a while.

  

Varenzai tries to spend time caring for the sloths and stuff

---

[[Session 2021.08.14 The Relaxation Grotto r]] -> [[Dimitrius]] | 2022-01-17
Caring for Sloths for Dimitrius -- he is very happy with the interest I show in them and the knowledge I bring, this is a ‘hot angle’ for him

---


  

Dimitrius is also very ok with Varenzai teaching Aurene to swim -- she very much prefers the cold water

It goes ok but not excellent -- she has rudimentary

  

TO GO OVER WITH MEG -- Got in touch with [[Aerindor]], figure out that actual conversation with her out of game -- and also how much progress

  

---

[[Session 2021.08.14 The Relaxation Grotto r]] -> [[Jadzia]] | 2022-01-17
Varenzai tries to talk to Jadzia with everyone about how she reacted in the Faewild, she pretty much just dodges it, says she doesn’t want to talk about personal things and the ‘main show’ main concern was the stuff with Briza-clone and the Winter Queen coming after us.

She is starting to recover physically, but Varenzai gets a sense she’s really struggling internally with the 3-year thing, it’s very hard for her.

[[Session 2021.08.14 The Relaxation Grotto r]] -> [[the Immortal Sanctum]] | 2022-01-17
Oh I guess I forgot to fill this in but we came to a pleasing end to our time there and they say we owe 8500 gold
