## RECAP

Firbolg community in ancient beautiful poison forest being haunted by a ghost -- ghost wants a ring back

**REMEMBER: Looking for a ring in the church**

Found old creepy church -- lot’s of snake iconography, flesh braziers CREEPY portraits, hands covered in blood after touch wall/leaving bloody footprints

Attacked by bone hand, shot it off.

NOTE: Heard some sort of buzzing but it’s very unnatural because no other bugs

  

I hear some sort of whistling coming form the darkness on this floor

  

I reach into the darkness -- cold, unnatural, nasty

  

I step into it, nothing really happens, clanking and whistling and buzzing stops, but nothing else really beyond it’s very uncomfortable, can’t see

I Arcana check the darkness, usually there’s some sort of source, a command or code by the person who created and controls it, sometimes very powerful magic light can get rid of it, or an object/trigger

  

Try lighting braziers? I go back downstairs, halfway down stairs a rapid knock knock at the door

I investigate braziers -- made of human flesh, it definitely seems ‘alive’ in some way -- it’s not going to jump out and attack me, doesn’t feel menacing, but it definitely feels cursed, for whoever these are made out of.

  

I light them -- horrible tortured screeching, as if something is burning, so near death but can’t die

The darkness dissipates, reveals the rest of the room.

There’s a 10’X10’ pit, 40’ deep, spikes with impaled remains, but they’re long since rotted, just some clothes and stuff remaining

  

I approach an altar, one hard knock at the door, hear some scittering behind us

  

**ALTAR:** 2 small glass Kloshes, 2-3” tall, one is empty, the inside looks incredibly clean relative to the outside

Inside the other is a pale mostly translucent spider, just passively resting in the klosh

Ethereal ‘blink’ spider -- comes from Ethereal (Verdant) planes. Very rare of them to just hang out, they generally have no reason to want to just hang out in the Material Plane, summoned or trapped here

Generally highly valued as collectibles or pets, they do have their own spider communities a la harry potter. Generally prefer to stick to themselves, they don’t pick fights with other creatures. They can poison people, that’s one reason to trade them.

Not mythical but very strange, would be in the window of an exotic pet shop.

A pale blue shimmer around it.

Single black unlit & unmelted candle

**Behind Altar:** Hanging from the ceiling, swaying slightly, meat hooks, 3 on each side, dried blood on them

  

Pile of bones and dried blood

One large painting, royal size huge, directly overtop of bone pile, Incredibly Obese Naked Human Man, blood down side of face and chin and chest

He doesn’t look horrified or suffering, smug, and like he’s been feasting

  

I pick up the spider Klosh, and free the blink spider, he blinks away

The other klosh wobbles a bit, something drips out, howl of creature outside

  

Feels like some sort of spiritual binding between the two klosh’s. The glob that came out doesn’t seem like blood but more like some kind of acid. Feels like idea of setting something free.

  

**The Pit:** Something shiny down it, like metallic jewellery -- I tie a rope to the pew, tell Thera to keep watch, she’s very uneasy. I climb down -- as I get closer I see it’s not a ring but like some kind of wrapped up pendant

As I get close enough to see it I feel a strange sense of dread like I’m seeing something unnatural

It’s incredibly plain, no symbols or gems, but made of a very nice metal, more like a locket

Wrapped slightly around bones like what was once a hand

Most recent bone in pit seems like only a few months old

The walls of the pit are covered in scratch marks, like those sent down trying to claw back up

  

I get back out and open the pendant -- Left Side -- a little circular mirror -- Right Side -- face of a very beautiful young human woman, dark hair up in a bun, loose with little flowers, portraitesque, soft smile, quite nice clothes. On her hand is a **beautiful ring with a small ruby**

  

I poke around the corpse pile, just bones and stuff, the painting is now looking at me

I poke a hole in the corner of the portrait.

Nothing happens while I watch the portrait except when I inadvertently glance away or blink -- body now has a wound in stomach, trail of blood -- now he looks pissed

A line of blood is trickling down from the hole

  

I start investigating the rest of the church again, lighting it with my torch as I go --I see boots with skeletal legs -- a skeleton in manacles, chain around body and arms, only has boots on. Leaning against back wall. One of it’s arms is stuck in the air, it’s flipping me off

  

I talk to the skeleton, he wants me to let him out. Asks what year it is, is like ‘riiiiight’. Behind him is a grandfather.

  

**THE RHYME OF THE SALTLICKER:**

“Lock the door, blow out the light;

The Saltlickler haunts the night.

Hide and tremble, little one;

The Saltlickler wants to have some fun.

Hear it scratching on the door;

See its shadow cross the floor.

The sun won’t rise for quite a while;

Till then beware the Saltlickler’s smile.”

  

  

The clock: very fancy and ornate, ticking backwards, very beautiful. On the front door where the body, some sort of symbol or maker’s mark

  

Farley the skeleton.

  

  

**THE HAG:**

Check out the rest of the church with Farley

The ripped open paintings the people in them are dead, that’s how they ‘go’

  

Open sores along throat and head and side

Short

White hair, lots of things like plants braided into it. Lots of clothes and sacks and rags

She’s wearing some kind of animal skull on her head, like a ram skull. Out of it is some sort of spine made from all kinds of different vertebrae from different animals. Limbs too short in some places, too long in others.

At her side is a sack, size of a basketball -- looks familiar in style to braziers, made of flesh, mostly faces, dripping onto ground

  

I gave her all my trust in return for the ring and letting everyone go

CHOICES WERE MADE, probably bad ones

  

Lots of buzzing noises and scittering

  

Human Woman, **Laurelay Rowley**, tell her I’m thinking of her
