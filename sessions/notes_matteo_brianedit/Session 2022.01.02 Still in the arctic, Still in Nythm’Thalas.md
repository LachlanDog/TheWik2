    

# Session: 02.01.2022: Still in the arctic, Still in Nythm’Thalas

We talk a bit about our plans going forward

-   What to say to the king
    
    -   DISCRETION
        
    -   Approach things as they come up, don’t just offer things up
        
        -   Don’t be shifty either
            
        -   Be polite
            
    -   Use our Big Ask on Godvale/Thera
        
        -   I owe Briza a pony in return
            
            -   Pinky promise
                

  

We go find a temple to remove our Rakshasha curse

-   Statue of stone fire
    
-   As we walk up to the temple, some people recognize us, starstruck from our victory
    
-   Lahne tags long
    
-   Chantry of fire
    

  

Temple to : **Kossuth: God of Flames**

**Pelor**: God of the sun, but need to consider the nature of the sun – where does light, radiance, and dawn come from

  

-   We all get remove curse
    
-   Lot of chaos inside, Briza & Holmgren antics
    
    -   Young apostle cleric types, they snicker at how the priest is getting annoyed
        
-   Fire temple, Varenzai waits outside, makes friends with surrounding pigeon flock
    
-   They all get remove-cursed inside
    
-   Priest comes outside, is nervous of pigeons
    
    -   Varenzai dissipates the pigeons away
        
-   Varenzai asks about their beliefs (see above RE Pelor), pays and gets removed cursed
    
    -   Varenzai donates another 10 PP
        

  

Continuing on:

-   Party goes to Scourge
    
-   Varenzai & Lachlan go shopping
    
    -   Vola also goes
        

I think in the end it’s decided that there’s no point to go to Scourge, and instead we split into two groups:

  

**Vola, Lachlan, & Varenzai**

**Erdantz’ Garment Store**

Very old elf man running the shop – upscale fancy garment store in the Opal Towers

  

-   Nice guy
    
    -   ‘So green!’
        
-   Prices range from a few silver to ~30 gp
    
    -   Lots of racks, change rooms, some seats for people waiting
        
        -   Some stuff ready to go off racks, others ready to go off shelf
            
        -   Bored kid on one seat
            
    -   Large back room where he does his work, lots back there
        
    -   Pyramid of thimbles on his counter
        
-   I go and explain have important meetings, ask for some garments
    
-   Lachlan sits on one of the seats and tries to meditate on the Talisman he gave to Roxanne
    
    -   It still exists
        
    -   It’s very far away
        
    -   (11 Arcana)
        

  

FANCY CLOTHES FROM NYTHM’THALAS

Vola Gets:

-   Very fancy tricorn hat with a feather
    
-   Blue Suit
    

  

Varenzai Gets:

-   Fancy clothes
    
-   Flowing green robe/suit with gold patterns/trim and a gold sash
    
-   Loose pants
    
-   Hat with a brim, pinned up on one side, feather, gold
    
-   Aurene:
    
    -   Blue with gold trim kind of cloak with a hood that I could put her in to kinda help make ambiguous she’s a dragon
        

  

Lachlan Gets:

-   Maroon jacket
    
-   Very nice scarf
    

  

**Holmgren & Briza**

Go to a very fancy ‘relaxation station’ – beautiful springs/ponds, some kind of colossal salamander thing in the pool

  

They both go for the ‘complete’ package no question about price

  

Briza gets a whole treatment, different rooms and saunas and stuff

-   Fish foot bath
    
-   Her skin colour starts to revert – less fluorescent blue, now a lighter blue
    

  

They’re big stars from the arena, so don’t even have to pay, get the whole great treatment

  

Ask someone about the king:

-   ‘He doesn’t seem like he’s all there’
    
-   “Especially now ‘wahh my wife’”
    
    -   She ‘died’ – long time ago
        
    -   Body is still in the throne room on display ‘Mr. Freeze type situation’
        
    -   “She’s dead, she’s there, but she made that choice if you know what I mean”
        
    -   “She was very unhappy” – pretty depressed, didn’t want to get married, never got to do anything she wanted
        
    -   “You need supplies, and when you want to do a spell like that, boy you need a lot of supplies”
        
    -   **Grandalfa** – name of this person who knows about the king of Nythm’Thalas in the relaxation place
        

  

**Important Courtly Names**

-   **King: Thramaluil**
    
-   **Queen: O’iara**
    
-   **Child: Nasir Yllaven**
    
-   **Child: Arun**
    

  

  

They were looking for some ‘kid’ who died ~4 years ago, that ended the war

-   This person was someone very skilled in magic who they thought could help, resurrect the queen or something
    
-   Had lots of beads in their hair
    
-   Aloy or Vorgrim?
    
    -   Probably **Aloy**
        

  

**Looking for Jadzia**

After shopping, Vola, Varenzai & Lachlan go back to the arena to speak to Scourge

  

Somewhat interrupt him while he’s working on something with his mom

  

Doesn’t work out

Mini Urzoth

  

“Send the shiny one tomorrow or the day after”

-   Holmgren picks up his goods
    

  

**Meeting Ka’La**

We meet at the Inn and tell each other about our days

  

Ka’la comes at supper as she promised, and says she found someone who will scry for us

  

We go through a less-built-up area and come to what seems to be a library

-   Book everywhere
    
-   Humid, plants growing
    
-   A personal library, but built to host/for people to come through
    

  

Ka’la calls out loudly “Zorra!” – echoes through

-   From behind a little staircase another elf that looks very similar to Ka’la comes down
    
    -   Hair bundled on head with a scarf, and flows out the top
        
    -   Septal piercing, gold & ornate, links to earing on ear
        
    -   Wears a warm-looking tunic, flowy as elven clothes are
        
-   Walks up without smiling, Lahne says ‘Hi ma!’
    

  

Ka’la seems much younger, protective, seems nervous like she wants to make sure to protect her sister.

  

**Zorra** speaks very directly & matter of factly – questions us about the direct parts of what we’re asking.

-   She knows about the Entheri
    

  

  

**The Whereabouts of Jadzia Bronzerock**

In a library!

-   Probably the same one we saw Jerome in
    
-   WTF are they doing there
    
-   Leave a note?
    
-   Zorra did not like the magenta colour of the floor
    
-   Architecture:
    
    -   Architecture built ~1000 years ago in the Flatlands of the Desert Continent – very distant
        
-   Book: Some form of Spellbook – Jerome’s?
    
    -   Is she gonna become a wizard?
        
    -   Book with black cover & binding and very very uneven writing – similar as Jerome’s
        

  

Sitting, slightly angled forward on a bench, with a book in her hands, eyes looking straight forward

-   Not reading the book, eyes were looking forward
    

  

Not one in Nythm’Thalas, or at least not one that Zorra recognized it

  

Wearing her autumn cloak

  

Was not as clean as Briza/Holmgren

  

Did not seem to be being attacked or anything

  

Where are you, are you ok, someone took the artifacts, zanzibar curse rakshasha, are you coming back, meeting king tomorrow.

  

“Who are you?”
