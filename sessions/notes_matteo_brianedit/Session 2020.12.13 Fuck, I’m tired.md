We arrive back in the aftermath of the fight

I do perception, nothing more coming, morning getting mistier.

## Briza & the Bear

Briza runs up to bear thing and says along the lines of “I know you want revenge on Jarl, but change back!”

-   ”I know you respect power and I know you just saw what we did to your bird” -- Uh oh, Roc was his pet?
    

  

BEAR CHANGES INTO A FROST GIANT -- **Vacmir** -- Matted hair, big scar down face, intense blue eyes

Briza had a discussion with him, basically if we help him he’ll take us to Godvale

He punches Holmgren for killing his Roc

Were-Polar Bear -- Cast out by tribe by Jarl for this unique ability, he wants to kill Jarl in revenge -- PolarWere **Vacmir** is a curse, if we’re not bitten while in Polar form we’ll be ok

If we help him, he’ll take us to the Godvale!!!

We think he wants us to heal the Jarl so he can have a fair fight to kill him proper.

  

We try to arrange that he’ll take us to Godvale (cursed place) first, and then he’ll help us, but he doesn’t want to pass through ‘that city’ (Frost Giant City?) on the way

  

We spend the next 40 minutes discussing how Holmgren, Jadzia, & Lachlan take drugs. Briza & Vola loot the bodies. I heal everyone, then Holmgren and Jadzia also heal people.

We arrange an order where I take point with **Vacmir** trying to look out ahead, I ask Vola to take the rear to keep an eye on everyone else as they go through

  

## Walking Along

Briza eats some chocolate and a sphere of darkness appears around her

As we go, random magical effects seem to happen to each of us:

  

Drugs, or ancient arctic wild magics?

Varenzai: Can’t see other living beings

Lachlan: Must kill a humanoid every week or will die himself

Jadzia: Says she’s fine, it’s not so severe -- Can’t kill anything

Vola: Anytime she does damage, it will be reflected back to a random party member

Holmgren: Can’t sleep within 60 feet of someone else

Briza: Venereal Darkness

  

We’re not quite sure what to do about it, Varenzai wants to keep pressing on and we’ll figure it out as we go

The Darkness sphere spreads to Holmgren

We seem to think this is all caused by the chocolate?

Briza *pretends* (we don’t know she’s pretending) to activate the antimagic field and says it does nothing

  

I try to verify where we’re going and make my own notations on Aerindor’s map as we go, I see she hasn’t been this way -- I make my own notes on it to fill in.

  

March for a long time, Holmgren whines, we find a cave to rest in, I fail a roll and fall into a pit

Otherwise good cave, Holmgren tries to find somewhere away from us to left, Jadzia takes out her staff, says ‘Grow’ in Sylvan, and a 60’ tree sprouts from her planted staff

  

Jadzia cures me with Greater Restoration, but reveals each cast of that costs 100gp worth of Diamond Dust, so she has a very limited amount of times she can cast it.

We debate who needs restoration, she goes for Lachlan next

  

  

## The Stranger

Vacmir says a stranger came -- “Hair and Horns and Chains, a Shadowy Figure” -- came a few months ago and influenced the Jarl, he may be who we have to deal with

  

Vacmir lead us somewhere, not the normal Frost Giant Fortress but somewhere else -- Vacmir said this is the last place he saw the Jarl and the **‘Stranger’** a few days ago

  

We get to the outskirts of this area and setup camp

  

The Stranger: Wooden rod/switch, covered in fur, no clothes, wears chains, horns not curved back but demonic looking, human-looking face with red eyes and very sharp teeth, has a tail -- some sort of demon-satyr? -- Carries a cloth bag

On all fours -- large frost giant with leash on -- satyr demon (KRAMPUS?!?) is walking him like a dog and whipping him with wooden switch thing.
