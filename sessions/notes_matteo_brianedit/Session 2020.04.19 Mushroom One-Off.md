Helping half-elf mayor of some small town (Raven’s Grove) outside of Slim-Tolic -- daughter is missing

Daughter: Diana, came to city and was adopted 2 years ago, ~15, not popular -- no known relations or connections in city.

Came from Western Lands (typically full of Bugbears and Orcs -- guy is guarded when telling Vola this)

Mayor himself is not popular, was a Tia’mat worshipper and has tattoos of that on his face.

Daughter left in middle of night after throwing a firebolt at Dad, ran into outskirts of forest.

-   OK SO CORRECTION:
    
-   Mayor has been mayor for 20 years
    
-   Worships Bahument now (there is a Bahument church in town)
    
-   Mayor is popular among the townsfolk, its travellers and sailors who don’t like him because of his past, but people in town trust and like him
    

  

Gotta ask Rose at the general store about the book she sold her

Vola & Varenzai & Thera went to question some Terri the Hunter at the local tavern.

Tavern owner, couple, human: Leeland & Moira

  

Grimwood Forest: Gloomy, scattered light, lots of dogwood, hemlock, and ferns. Lots of mushrooms.

Parasol

Mushrooms, kicked out of home.
