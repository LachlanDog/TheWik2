    

# Session: 19.12.2021: The Fourth Corpse of Briza, or: Awakenings, or: The Morning of Pointless Secrets

After dying in the dream, Briza wakes up feeling like absolute shit. She has 4 points of exhaustion

  

Looking around she sees our room has been ransacked, shit thrown everywhere and out of the bags

  

Someone outside is pitter-pattering around and knocking, trying to get in

  

The contents of the bag of holding are everywhere

  

Some young arctic elf guy is at the door

-   HE HAS FUCKING KUDZU ON HIS BACK
    
-   **Lahne:** name, got kudzu for his birthday
    
    -   Son of **Shelly**
        
    -   Nephew of **General Ka’la**
        
        -   ‘But you’ve met her already right? She’s really nice’
            
        -   ‘She sent me up, I wasn’t supposed to be leading the questions but now I think I am’
            
-   Has a cute fluffy mini pet mammoth thing
    
    -   Lahne Mammoth Name: **Bramble**
        

  

Briza & Lahne clean the room and then Briza wakes Vola up

  

Briza pokes Vola in the face till she wakes up and she whacks her in her panic.

Vola wakes up with all the knowledge/memories from the dream world.

  

  

Lahne Ka’la, waiting for us at place, Lahne is a beastmaster, about 40 year old elf lad.

  

Died, cut it open, nothing there

Residual energy, went hunting the tomb tapper, found it’s lair with all the loot it had eaten.

**Ka’la** is **Lahne’s** aunt

-   Once she died, gave him Kudzu as a present
    

  

Ka’la conversation goes terribly

-   No clear direction, we kind of overload her with lots of conflicting information and then insult her somehow?
    
-   But in the end it seems like she’ll help us?
    
-   We tell her a lot of things about what we’re up to, but only really half-way
