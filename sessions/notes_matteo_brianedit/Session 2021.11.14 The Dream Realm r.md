    

# Session: 14.11.2021: The Dream Realm

We roll shit on history, but can piece together that we’re somewhere else -- dream plane of something.

Jadzia isn’t here -- so we can’t ask her anything?

  
---

[[Session 2021.11.14 The Dream Realm r]] -> [[Dream Plane]] | 2022-01-17

 **Plane of Dreams**

Chaotic

Doesn’t make sense

Not an abyss or plane of hell -- but just like a dream it can be nightmarish

---


Not sure if there are any kinds of rules, or creatures here

  

The environment is like looking through a kaleidoscope or rose colour glasses -- all a bit hazy, and the more we look at something the closer it seems

---

[[Session 2021.11.14 The Dream Realm r]] -> [[Dream Plane]] | 2022-01-17
Landscape is always shifting

---


  

  

Ourselves and our companions seem ‘constant’

Everything else around us is shifty, and kind of dark, distant

  

**Varenzia Perception Check**

The only constant is that it’s not constant.

At a distance, there seems to be some kind of storm.

-   Also kinda constant
    
-   Stays where it is

**Holmgren’s God says Zanzibar is somehow involved**

---


  

**Vola Commune with Nature**

It’s very unnatural to her

As she settles in and focuses on all of this, she notices other people and creatures that kind of fade in than out

Not exactly corporeal, or like they’re really here or not

-   Things like bugbears fighting in a coffee shop
    
-   Vola as a child running around, having a fight with another kid
    
    -   Has hair as a child, it gets caught as she’s fighting
        

  

  

---

[[Session 2021.11.14 The Dream Realm r]] -> [[Dendar]] | 2022-01-17
**Dendar:** Serpent thing that eats nightmares

---


-   Could potentially be connected
    
-   But she’s more associated with the **Fugue Plane**, part of the **Astral Plane**
    

  

  

---

[[Session 2021.11.14 The Dream Realm r]] -> [[Dream Plane]] | 2022-01-17
‘When you take a dream from the dreaming world, all the things that could have been die, and only the things it is survive.’

---


  

As she says this, we start to see more of Vola’s day -- it’s like watching a TV show of any day in her life, could be some monotonous day

  

**Vola’s Day**

She’s sitting outside, alone in a clearing, maybe like a camp

There are mountains in the background

This is 5-7 years ago so she’s late teen/early 20’s -- no hair at this point

  

Another female half-orc (Brene) with short hair walks up, hands her a nug of something, and they just start talking, chatting about this that everything and nothing.

Lachlan asks about this, Vola is fairly deadpan and is like ‘she was a friend, she’s doing something in another city’

Varenzai insight checks her as the scene goes. She has that sort of sad wistful nostalgia, not necessarily regret (though not that that’s absent), more remembering something nice.

  

---

[[Session 2021.11.14 The Dream Realm r]] -> [[Brene Gorel]] | 2022-01-17
Brene Gorel: In Kurn’Feldor, the capital of the region. Not like she had to leave, but more to master smithing and get to the next level, had to go somewhere bigger to take the next steps.

---

  

**Holmgren Day**

Holmgren also sees a memory

Just one of the days from AFTER when he was in the military

Was taken in by some sort of religious man at a kind of monastery

Training and working with the people there

---

[[Session 2021.11.14 The Dream Realm r]] -> [[Holmgren]] | 2022-01-17
After military, before the scattering when they were attacked, killed, scattered to the wind

  

“Another time when I didn’t know a lot about the way things were, I wish it had stayed that way.”

**Mentor Dude:** Older guy, ‘normal seeming dude’, not wearing ragged clothing, but very simple, like any guy on the street. No religious either. Functional and very wearable clothes.

-   Comes across as very wise, like you go away from him having learned a lesson
    
-   **Holmgren Mentor Name:** **[[Ezechiel Sansonae]]**
    
-   **Holmgren Monastery Religion:** **[[Eldath]]**

---


  

Holmgren and another guy are working, wearing similar kind of clothes, mentor is watching from a tree.

There’s a dwarf family around, they’re exchanging some small talk with the children

  

They’re doing work for the community, helping them with their town, help the community in general.

  

Holmgren goes around helping as he can, offering to do what he can. Gets along well with animals, leading horses and stuff.

  

  

---

[[Session 2021.11.14 The Dream Realm r]] -> [[Lachlan]] | 2022-01-17
**Lachlan Vision**

From his days on **The Drunkard’s Waltz** -- Gambling/Pleasure boat that he was on

Kind of ship that goes port to port, ready to raise anchor and move on quickly as the winds change

  

Lachlan is going around on the boat

There’s an older man, seems annoyed a dog is there

Another woman is there, talks about how animals have feelings etc.

Man is accused of cheating, and a heated argument ensues

Eventually the man is thrown overboard into shallow water, walks off in the huff

Cheering and revelry ensues

Lachaln walks around with a sense of confidence and belonging like ‘you’re in my house here’

Holmgren does what roles he can, like trying to serve drinks although he’s not well adapted to it

Some of the crew/bouncer-types are his buddies

E.g. one guy no-one has seen before approaches, walks up, Lachlan barks at him, and the bouncers block his pass like ‘dog doesn’t like you, sorry, you can’t come on’

  

JUST BEFORE AWAKENING: Lachlan was just the ship’s dog at this point

-   Seems a bit younger, eyes brighter
    
-   He isn’t exactly like fully aware of anything, but as an animal has intuition about the people
    

  

He remembers this, but now has more insight about it, can make connections -- remembers emotions a lot, remembers the people. He was happy, the days blended together a lot.

  

This was a few years ago, ~4 years ago.

  

Upheaval leaving the boat -- it wasn’t just a big life change, but also he was leaving people he had been seeing every day

-   Maybe never saw them again

---

    

**Mrs. Willows** took care of people in ways they didn’t know how to take care of themselves

  

---

[[Session 2021.11.14 The Dream Realm r]] -> [[varenzai]] | 2022-01-17
**Varenzai Vision**

Scene from the Faelar academy ~60 years ago

[[Elyra]], [[Daesyk]], & Varenzai are around a table, working on [[Kudzu]]. Varenzai has Kudzu on table, Daesky is reading in a book (of enchantments, magic). Elyra is quietly watching with her ae at her side.

  

[[Kys]] & [[Taern]] are at another table drinking and arm wrestling, make some comment about hurrying it up to get to the Grotto before dusk, and Varenzai makes a comment back.

---


  

  

---

[[Session 2021.11.14 The Dream Realm r]] -> [[briza]] | 2022-01-17
Briza repeats her comment: ‘Everytime you take a dream from the dream world, all the things that could have been die, and only the things it is survive.’

---


  

We look at the visions, and see them almost imposed on a series of strings, seeming nonsensical

We see Vola’s vision, we see her consider something then take a drink, and strings and branches fall away. She reaches forward to tend the fire, burns her fingertips, and more branches and strings fall away.

  

This time, we start to see something different happen:

  

  

Scene of something Vola could have been doing instead

-   E.g. she doesn’t learn blacksmithing, she doesn’t pick up a hammer, she moves away to a different land
    

We each see some change like this

  

**Vola:**

The streets of Kurn’Feldor, just a glimpse of them

A hooded cloaked figure goes into a store, Vola follows here

It’s just an ordinary general store, they go around separately shopping

The figure comes over, and hands her something ‘look, they made those biscuits you love!’

Still no hair, same general demeanour

She carries herself more or less the same

Hands black from blacksmithing

Clothes rougher, worse for wear

  

Just having a normal day, getting groceries

  

Vola is a good competent smith, but also not like an expert master blacksmith. Just a good skilled tradesperson, from what she learned with her parents. Doesn’t want to do a formal program because she’s already learned what she’s needed to.

  

She gets a little bored. Has a nice comfortable life, but not out there. She’d see adventurers pass through Kurn’Feldur, with all kinds of scratches and bruises and wounds, but they seem to carry themselves in this high self-assured manner. Tell Vola stories of things she couldn’t even dream of.

  

Brene Appearance: A little taller than Vola, sporty/athletic build (leaner etc.) -- jump on your back, arm wrestle, very physical

  

**Holmgren**

Elaborate pomp-and-circumstance type ceremony

Holmgren is much older than he is now, very sombre

Men on horses around him, also sombre.

Dark rainy day.

Dressed in armour that is silver with tints of blue

  

Another group with horses trots out, in black armour, with different insignia

  

They meet under flags of peace.

Some other guy on Holmgren’s side come over, clearly of some higher rank

Holmgren has badges and stuff, clearly served with distinction for a while

  

Guy on other side is huge, 8’ tall, dismounts

  

General idea: a future where Holmgren ended up on the wrong side of something

Seems like this is a sort of surrender ceremony

Holmgren is startled by the sight of himself, especially in full military regalia when he himself left that life

HOLMGREN WAS NOT ON THE WINNING SIDE HE WAS ON THE SURRENDERING SIDE

  

---

[[Session 2021.11.14 The Dream Realm r]] -> [[Holmgren]] | 2022-01-17
**Holmgren Army =** **The Western Army**

---


Holmgren doesn’t recognize the other side in the black armour, they’re not exactly clear. Armour is constantly shifting with lines and stuff, they seem strange and alien.

His army is clearly still the western army.

Holmgren is forlorn in this scenario

-   Physically seems a bit healthier, and with how he carries himself
    

He gives off this attitude of this is my business, very serious, this is what my life is

  

  

**Lachlan**

~age he was in last vision

Not on a boat -- in ribbons and tassels

Fine wood furniture around him, porcelain bowls full of food

Goes around -- beauty-and-the-beast massive mansion hall

A woman comes and picks him up, as she does she calls him ‘**Alfie**’ -- he licks her face as she does

She gives him a lot of baby talk

He has a different collar on from his normal one

He’s very cared for, pampered

There are 2 other Boston Terrier’s, also pampered

Fight on the walk and stuff

Lachlan is very friendly & playful with the other dogs

They each have individual embroidered pillows to sleep on

Get a whole roast chicken instead of dog food

Chubbier, but more buoyant in how he walks around

-   Not trained, will destroy cushions etc.
    

  

Old woman not Mrs. Willows -- big overdone hair.

  

**Varenzai**

Ambush with Elyra & Thera

Varenzai is crouching on a branch up in trees on a canopy, overlooking some twilit path through a forest.

Voices and noises in the distance.

---

[[Session 2021.11.14 The Dream Realm r]] -> [[varenzai]] | 2022-01-17
Coming out of the shadows, Elyra leans in, squeezes his shoulders, and gives him a kiss on the cheek before disappearing back into the shadows going further into the dark foliage.

---


  

A group of four [[Entheri]] wearing the same kind of armour/uniform walk under the tree. In a soundless simultaneous motion, Elyra drops from the trees directly over them while Varenzai looses an arrow from Kudzu, A trail of stars and darkness follows her axe as she swings it through the air and brings it down on her target.

  

Thera viciously jumps out from the surrounding thicket and joins the fray, seeming even more vicious and focused.

  

As the fight ensues, one starts to run away, Thera initially goes to chase after but Elyra calls something out and she instantly stops. Varenzai takes a different arrow from his quiver and fires after, hitting the runner square in the back. The runner bursts into flames, screaming, igniting some of the surrounding plants aflame and the vision fades.

  

  

**Aftermath**

These visions fade, and we come back to the world around us. We *know* those visions aren’t real, but we get the feeling they very much could be real if things were just a little different.

Coming back into the swirling dream plane, and it’s almost comforting over the uncanny valley we just went through.

It seems like we’ve fully watched each of these visions, it seems like the whole time they took occurred.

-   But we see Vola is still doing her ritual, it hasn’t even been 11 minutes.
    

  

  

BAsed on this, and the knowledge that things could have been very different with just a few changes, we get to multiclass one level into something else!!
