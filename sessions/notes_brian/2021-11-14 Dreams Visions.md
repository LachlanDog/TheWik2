The [[Dream Plane]], hunted by [[Rakshasa]]

Erzof was on the minotaur team, they don't remember her.

Spells didnt work on Rakshasa at all, even up to lvl 5

Attacks were also extremely ineffective

Jadzia not here with us, was not part of the fight, didn't get scratched by Rak.

Nothing constant, lightning storm... can hear it?

See if someone can wake us up or remove curse? Or will we disapear?

Storm seems constant, other things change...

#RpgGames Describing our dreams or a day in life? Going around group... Child or adult, something that happened... Asking follow up questions to help. Sort of like asking PC backstories, basically. Was fun, can pass a session like that and its fun. Like... worldbuilding together, or adding character depth. Or Alternative timelines

[[Vola]], 25, 7 years ago, sitting outside, mountains, campfire. No hair
Other orc, short hair, talk, about hunting etc

#RpgMechanics having player answer insight checks against them. Seems to work well imo
