Junior clerics copying scripts

Older guy tut tuting a kid

---
Sidenote: me participating less may also do that thing so others play?

---

Lord of flames, kothas?

Is the temple cool with umberly?

Lonnie knows where to go in the temple

Varenzai scared of fire temple, 

Briza priest that Clay is on a holy quest for Umberly

11:15 funny cats his cursed remove too

Vola curse removed

11:17 Holm + Briza

Briza talking to younger clerics , dwarf girl who like pranks

Tells Briza fireworks in cabinet uh oh

Other younger clerics like uhhh

11:19 basically keep myself out of spotlight? Again 5 players is alot...

Varenzai outside by small shops, bakery pigeons. Wonder how much is player quantity? #dnd 

11:22 doing chores cleaning while dnd

---

Verizon asks priest what the fire thing is like. Radiance of the Dawn

Varenzai uncursed

Briza gets fireworks, steals

Gives dwarf girl fireworks. Tells on her, we have to leave

---

Elf child there just hates shopping, whiny

Shop 30x30
Fancy, nice things for altering. 
Fancy tailor's, handsew

#Vorgrim !!!


---

13:11 We go see scourge for some reason?

I try to pretend to be erzorf to see my contract, don't work

No info Gained but we tried

13:27 Kala meets us at the tavern

Someone agreed to scry for us, to find jadzia, apparently launy knows them but he's an idiot so didn't think of it

13:29 temple? No library

Humidity, plants, someone's personal library seems like? Yet public...

Tapestries, none really match

Books everywhere

Kala calls for [[Zora]] elf hair is bundled on top of head, scarf ancara style. Septal piercing gold, links to eareing, warm looking tunic, flowey

Doesn't smile, launy says hey ma!!
Kalas sister!!!

Autistic? Extremely no idioms.
Zora is older

Autistic, fun?

---

13:54 ask her to scry, see what happens

Reptiles through the ages, Brontosaurus . Emptied isle. Lachlan looks for more dinosaur books for fun

Zora has scribed, very successful, entire ten minutes. Now to get info somehow...

Inside of a room, filled with books, assumes library, fair guess. Not this library. Not a library in this city, Zora has never been there.

Daylight coming through windows, fires are not advised in libraries. Saw several magic fires, orange in nature not hot.

Had cloak on. Not as clean as Briza.

Not reading a book.
Magenta. 

> [[2022-01-02 Curse removal, and Korra, scry on Jadzia]] -> [[Jadzia Missing]] | 2022-01-14
> Jadzia missing, clue when scryed:
Descendent of architecture 1000 yrs ago in flatlands. Dessert.

Spellbook. 

sending spell, Jadzia answer cliff hanger

reread - Vorgrims letter

# Personal thoughts on group gaming
2022-01-02
- Trying to give people space to play?
- Varen wants thera + shopping
- Being less active may help game? Sort of how I bow out when problems? Speak over people less? Could try it
- Do Pocket Operator funzies? Chores?
- Letting others talk, plus Clay can talk now without lag!
- Maybe 5 players is a lot anyways?
- Is my input always micro-managing, taking spotlight, unfun? Well maybe not ALWAYS, but maybe too often?
- Just come in every once and a while? Basically let others run things? could think like "be a guest star"?
- Definitely less pressure, feels okay?
