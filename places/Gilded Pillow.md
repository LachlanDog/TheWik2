[Session 2020.07.12 Holmgren the Devil Worshipper r](TheWik-main/sessions/notes_matteo_brianedit/Session%202020.07.12%20Holmgren%20the%20Devil%20Worshipper%20r.md) -> [Gilded Pillow](Gilded%20Pillow.md) | 2022-01-19
After this, we go to the Gilded Pillow to investigate Bolero

At the [[Gilded Pillow]]

-   We walk in, Holmgren very unsuccessfully tries to bribe the receptionist, but Vola talks our way in -- she says Bolero has been there, but someone new is staying in his room
    
-   They let us up, the room is: 6th floor, 10 doors down from elevator -- I give a great tip to the person who brought us to give us time
    
-   Holmgren teleports in and leaves us outside, doesn’t convey anything
    
-   Inside is Zanzibar, they talk a bit, she says something about getting rid of things entangling Holmgren so he’s free to go with her
    
-   Briza finally picks the lock after ~10 mins and we bust in. Zanzibar runs, in the next room we see a blonde woman (not Tora) who looks scarred and very beaten. We find Tora’s scimitar there too. We end here.6
