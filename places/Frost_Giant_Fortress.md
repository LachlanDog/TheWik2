[[Session 2021.01.17 Where’s Krampus r]] -> [[Frost_Giant_Fortress]] | 2022-01-18
As we go into the fortress its littered with bodies, Briza recognizes some, does not like them.

Massive massive cavern lined by giant dragon bones.

Keep going into large massive cavernous places, some where Briza hadn’t been able to go before or some where she could get but the giants could have

Some horrific smells and such around where the Frost Giants tore bones like fortune cookies

[[Session 2021.01.17 Where’s Krampus r]] -> [[Frost_Giant_Fortress]] | 2022-01-18
We get to a room that’s mostly stone, some ice, as though the raw side of the mountain. It was Briza’s quarters, distant from the main hall, very not nice place, a sort of ‘we hate you so go live over there’ Harry Potter under the stairs type deal

  

  

As we continue in we get to a very fancy door with some markings on it, this is the door Briza could never get through when exploring

  

The engravings are in Celestial, Holmgren is (finally) able to read it. It says something about the formation of the world, the primordial gods coming together to make it, they fear one things

Men desire me in public and fear me in private.

  

“In the time before time, the gods sprang fully formed from the primeval void. All these ﬁrst gods were equally endowed with the power of the cosmos, and each claimed jurisdiction over certain aspects of the universe. In a spirit of cooperation that has not been seen since, they built the worlds together, separating matter from energy, land from sea, and sky from earth. They only fear one thing.

Men alike desire me in public, but fear me in private.”

  

Briza has a flask of dirt.

  

Kala ends up being the smart one, casts Tongues or something on herself, and says “The Truth” in celestial, allowing the door to open.

[[Session 2021.01.17 Where’s Krampus r]] -> [[Frost_Giant_Fortress]] | 2022-01-18
We go into an old-timey like study, so many quills and books with old bindings. A pedestal on the left has a cloth covering something circular.

Beside it, near desk, some sort of shattered glass crystal thing that looks like it once had something in it now gone.

  

Behind desk is a mummified, at least dead for 100 years, emaciated, wearing a fine scholars robe with gold embroidery, greyish skinned, older version of Briza, not just like related, but looks exactly like Briza. Same hair and everything but not blue.

ASK KALA HOW SHE KNOWS BRIZA AND WHAT THIS IS AND DO SOME CHECK ON THE BODY  
Theory: Based on how it seems like Kala knows another version of Briza, and what we saw with Aloy, is it possible Briza did the same sort of thing, making and inhabiting a clone body, but for some reason she doesn’t remember. And this is the old one?

Theory 2 (unrelated): Kala is here looking for things related to whatever made them fail in what they were trying to get from the Godvale.

Before this keep was taken by the Frost Giants it was the fortress of a Cloud Dragon.

[[Session 2021.01.17 Briza’s Body r]] -> [[Frost_Giant_Fortress]] | 2022-01-18
Runes along the wall, iconography dragon and lunar

A lot of the bodies are not tossed around or in the middle of doing something, they’re all laying in bed in their cots like they died lying there.

What is on their skeletal remains is very simple, like this is a temple -- seems like this was a temple to Bahamut once, but based on the stories told in the pictures this isn’t the original Bahamut as I know it but some different sect.

There is one picture in particular that a lot of the stories and images lean to, and it looks like a fabric carved into the stones
