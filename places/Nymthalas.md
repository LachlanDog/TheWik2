The first 3 gates go through a mountain, [[The Voiceless Summit]]. The rest go out and go higher and higher to give a high ground. Mountainscape up and behind, so Nythm’Thalas is heavily defensible built around mountains

Gothic-elvish design, very dark, made of black stone and curved marble

Despite the dark aesthetic the city has a liveliness about it, markets and guilds

Given elves have dark vision, city is sort of darker than a typical city.

  

Lots of elves around, some of other races, but NO DWARVES <3

Nythm’Thalas is a bureaucracy

[[Session 2021.08.14 The Relaxation Grotto r]] -> [[Nymthalas]] | 2022-01-17
Was very well travelled, ‘well, more now’

The ends of the roads are guarded, especially Nythm’Thalas

-   Small mountain pass -- Belly of the Voiceless Summit
    
-   7 gates protect the city, constant guard, made of different things
    
-   Bounded by dark stone
    
-   ½ day walk at normal speed
    

‘A situation between Nythm’Thalas and some surrounding cities’ Many lives were lost, king was adamant about maintaining this aggression until he reached a certain but king thinks his goal is impossible now, so he’s opening Nythm’Thalas to the world again

Politically more of the same, lots of tension between Ko’Themar and Nythm’Thalas, dwarves aren’t welcome there but we should be able to get in

  

They say it’s ‘lent’ right now in Nythm’Thalas, they’re being boring, [[Brightfather Festival of Spring]] -- Celebrates Corolon

**Aerindor** says that there’s almost certainly people in Nythm’Thalas we could ask who know these things, almost all knowledge of anything especially this magic stuff is available there

**Aerindor** says we wouldn’t be arrested or anything when we arrived at **Nythm’Thalas**, but it wouldn’t be like a warm reception or anything. She says we’ll be fine so long as we “Don’t insult the big guy, don’t insult his wife”.
