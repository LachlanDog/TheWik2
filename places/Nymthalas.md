The first 3 gates go through a mountain, [[The Voiceless Summit]]. The rest go out and go higher and higher to give a high ground. Mountainscape up and behind, so Nythm’Thalas is heavily defensible built around mountains

Gothic-elvish design, very dark, made of black stone and curved marble

Despite the dark aesthetic the city has a liveliness about it, markets and guilds

Given elves have dark vision, city is sort of darker than a typical city.

  

Lots of elves around, some of other races, but NO DWARVES <3

Was very well travelled, ‘well, more now’

The ends of the roads are guarded, especially Nythm’Thalas

-   Small mountain pass -- Belly of the Voiceless Summit
    
-   7 gates protect the city, constant guard, made of different things
    
-   Bounded by dark stone
    
-   ½ day walk at normal speed
    

‘A situation between Nythm’Thalas and some surrounding cities’ Many lives were lost, king was adamant about maintaining this aggression until he reached a certain but king thinks his goal is impossible now, so he’s opening Nythm’Thalas to the world again
